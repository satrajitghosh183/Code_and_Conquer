  "description": "A city is represented as a **bi-directional connected** graph with `n` vertices where each vertex is labeled from `1` to `n` (**inclusive**). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array `edges`, where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex `ui` and vertex `vi`. Every vertex pair is connected by **at most one** edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself. The time taken to traverse any edge is `time` minutes.\n\nEach vertex has a traffic signal which changes its color from **green** to **red** and vice versa every `change` minutes. All signals change **at the same time**. You can enter a vertex at **any time**, but can leave a vertex **only when the signal is green**. You **cannot wait** at a vertex if the signal is **green**.\n\nThe **second minimum value** is defined as the smallest value **strictly larger** than the minimum value.\n\n*   For example the second minimum value of `[2, 3, 4]` is `3`, and the second minimum value of `[2, 2, 4]` is `4`.\n\nGiven `n`, `edges`, `time`, and `change`, return _the **second minimum time** it will take to go from vertex_ `1` _to vertex_ `n`.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n*   You can go through any vertex **any** number of times, **including** `1` and `n`.\n*   You can assume that when the journey **starts**, all signals have just turned **green**.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n       \n\n**Input:** n = 5, edges = \\[\\[1,2\\],\\[1,3\\],\\[1,4\\],\\[3,4\\],\\[4,5\\]\\], time = 3, change = 5\n**Output:** 13\n**Explanation:**\nThe figure on the left shows the given graph.\nThe blue path in the figure on the right is the minimum time path.\nThe time taken is:\n- Start at 1, time elapsed=0\n- 1 -> 4: 3 minutes, time elapsed=3\n- 4 -> 5: 3 minutes, time elapsed=6\nHence the minimum time needed is 6 minutes.\n\nThe red path shows the path to get the second minimum time.\n- Start at 1, time elapsed=0\n- 1 -> 3: 3 minutes, time elapsed=3\n- 3 -> 4: 3 minutes, time elapsed=6\n- Wait at 4 for 4 minutes, time elapsed=10\n- 4 -> 5: 3 minutes, time elapsed=13\nHence the second minimum time is 13 minutes.      \n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 2, edges = \\[\\[1,2\\]\\], time = 3, change = 2\n**Output:** 11\n**Explanation:**\nThe minimum time path is 1 -> 2 with time = 3 minutes.\nThe second minimum time path is 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 with time = 11 minutes.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= n <= 104`\n*   `n - 1 <= edges.length <= min(2 * 104, n * (n - 1) / 2)`\n*   `edges[i].length == 2`\n*   `1 <= ui, vi <= n`\n*   `ui != vi`\n*   There are no duplicate edges.\n*   Each vertex can be reached directly or indirectly from every other vertex.\n*   `1 <= time, change <= 103`",
