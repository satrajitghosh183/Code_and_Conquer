  "description": "You are given `n` **BST (binary search tree) root nodes** for `n` separate BSTs stored in an array `trees` (**0-indexed**). Each BST in `trees` has **at most 3 nodes**, and no two roots have the same value. In one operation, you can:\n\n*   Select two **distinct** indices `i` and `j` such that the value stored at one of the **leaves** of `trees[i]` is equal to the **root value** of `trees[j]`.\n*   Replace the leaf node in `trees[i]` with `trees[j]`.\n*   Remove `trees[j]` from `trees`.\n\nReturn _the **root** of the resulting BST if it is possible to form a valid BST after performing_ `n - 1` _operations, or_ `null` _if it is impossible to create a valid BST_.\n\nA BST (binary search tree) is a binary tree where each node satisfies the following property:\n\n*   Every node in the node's left subtree has a value **strictly less** than the node's value.\n*   Every node in the node's right subtree has a value **strictly greater** than the node's value.\n\nA leaf is a node that has no children.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** trees = \\[\\[2,1\\],\\[3,2,5\\],\\[5,4\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[3,2,5,1,null,4\\]\n**Explanation:**\nIn the first operation, pick i=1 and j=0, and merge trees\\[0\\] into trees\\[1\\].\nDelete trees\\[0\\], so trees = \\[\\[3,2,5,1\\],\\[5,4\\]\\].\n \nIn the second operation, pick i=0 and j=1, and merge trees\\[1\\] into trees\\[0\\].\nDelete trees\\[1\\], so trees = \\[\\[3,2,5,1,null,4\\]\\].\n \nThe resulting tree, shown above, is a valid BST, so return its root.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** trees = \\[\\[5,3,8\\],\\[3,2,6\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[\\]\n**Explanation:**\nPick i=0 and j=1 and merge trees\\[1\\] into trees\\[0\\].\nDelete trees\\[1\\], so trees = \\[\\[5,3,8,2,6\\]\\].\n \nThe resulting tree is shown above. This is the only valid operation that can be performed, but the resulting tree is not a valid BST, so return null.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** trees = \\[\\[5,4\\],\\[3\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[\\]\n**Explanation:** It is impossible to perform any operations.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == trees.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 5 * 104`\n*   The number of nodes in each tree is in the range `[1, 3]`.\n*   Each node in the input may have children but no grandchildren.\n*   No two roots of `trees` have the same value.\n*   All the trees in the input are **valid BSTs**.\n*   `1 <= TreeNode.val <= 5 * 104`.",
