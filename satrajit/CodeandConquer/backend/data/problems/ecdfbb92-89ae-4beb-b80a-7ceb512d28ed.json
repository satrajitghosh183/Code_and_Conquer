  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` integer matrix `grid` and an integer `k`. You are currently at position `(0, 0)` and you want to reach position `(m - 1, n - 1)` moving only **down** or **right**.\n\nReturn _the number of paths where the sum of the elements on the path is divisible by_ `k`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[5,2,4\\],\\[3,0,5\\],\\[0,7,2\\]\\], k = 3\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** There are two paths where the sum of the elements on the path is divisible by k.\nThe first path highlighted in red has a sum of 5 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 2 = 18 which is divisible by 3.\nThe second path highlighted in blue has a sum of 5 + 3 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 15 which is divisible by 3.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[0,0\\]\\], k = 5\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** The path highlighted in red has a sum of 0 + 0 = 0 which is divisible by 5.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[7,3,4,9\\],\\[2,3,6,2\\],\\[2,3,7,0\\]\\], k = 1\n**Output:** 10\n**Explanation:** Every integer is divisible by 1 so the sum of the elements on every possible path is divisible by k.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `m == grid.length`\n*   `n == grid[i].length`\n*   `1 <= m, n <= 5 * 104`\n*   `1 <= m * n <= 5 * 104`\n*   `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`\n*   `1 <= k <= 50`",
