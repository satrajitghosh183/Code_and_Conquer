  "description": "You are given an integer array `ranks` representing the **ranks** of some mechanics. ranksi is the rank of the ith mechanic. A mechanic with a rank `r` can repair n cars in `r * n2` minutes.\n\nYou are also given an integer `cars` representing the total number of cars waiting in the garage to be repaired.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** time taken to repair all the cars._\n\n**Note:** All the mechanics can repair the cars simultaneously.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** ranks = \\[4,2,3,1\\], cars = 10\n**Output:** 16\n**Explanation:** \n- The first mechanic will repair two cars. The time required is 4 \\* 2 \\* 2 = 16 minutes.\n- The second mechanic will repair two cars. The time required is 2 \\* 2 \\* 2 = 8 minutes.\n- The third mechanic will repair two cars. The time required is 3 \\* 2 \\* 2 = 12 minutes.\n- The fourth mechanic will repair four cars. The time required is 1 \\* 4 \\* 4 = 16 minutes.\nIt can be proved that the cars cannot be repaired in less than 16 minutes.​​​​​\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** ranks = \\[5,1,8\\], cars = 6\n**Output:** 16\n**Explanation:** \n- The first mechanic will repair one car. The time required is 5 \\* 1 \\* 1 = 5 minutes.\n- The second mechanic will repair four cars. The time required is 1 \\* 4 \\* 4 = 16 minutes.\n- The third mechanic will repair one car. The time required is 8 \\* 1 \\* 1 = 8 minutes.\nIt can be proved that the cars cannot be repaired in less than 16 minutes.​​​​​\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= ranks.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= ranks[i] <= 100`\n*   `1 <= cars <= 106`",
