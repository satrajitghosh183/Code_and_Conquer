  "description": "A generic microwave supports cooking times for:\n\n*   at least `1` second.\n*   at most `99` minutes and `99` seconds.\n\nTo set the cooking time, you push **at most four digits**. The microwave normalizes what you push as four digits by **prepending zeroes**. It interprets the **first** two digits as the minutes and the **last** two digits as the seconds. It then **adds** them up as the cooking time. For example,\n\n*   You push `9` `5` `4` (three digits). It is normalized as `0954` and interpreted as `9` minutes and `54` seconds.\n*   You push `0` `0` `0` `8` (four digits). It is interpreted as `0` minutes and `8` seconds.\n*   You push `8` `0` `9` `0`. It is interpreted as `80` minutes and `90` seconds.\n*   You push `8` `1` `3` `0`. It is interpreted as `81` minutes and `30` seconds.\n\nYou are given integers `startAt`, `moveCost`, `pushCost`, and `targetSeconds`. **Initially**, your finger is on the digit `startAt`. Moving the finger above **any specific digit** costs `moveCost` units of fatigue. Pushing the digit below the finger **once** costs `pushCost` units of fatigue.\n\nThere can be multiple ways to set the microwave to cook for `targetSeconds` seconds but you are interested in the way with the minimum cost.\n\nReturn _the **minimum cost** to set_ `targetSeconds` _seconds of cooking time_.\n\nRemember that one minute consists of `60` seconds.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** startAt = 1, moveCost = 2, pushCost = 1, targetSeconds = 600\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:** The following are the possible ways to set the cooking time.\n- 1 0 0 0, interpreted as 10 minutes and 0 seconds.\n  The finger is already on digit 1, pushes 1 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), pushes 0 (with cost 1), pushes 0 (with cost 1), and pushes 0 (with cost 1).\n  The cost is: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6. This is the minimum cost.\n- 0 9 6 0, interpreted as 9 minutes and 60 seconds. That is also 600 seconds.\n  The finger moves to 0 (with cost 2), pushes 0 (with cost 1), moves to 9 (with cost 2), pushes 9 (with cost 1), moves to 6 (with cost 2), pushes 6 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), and pushes 0 (with cost 1).\n  The cost is: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 12.\n- 9 6 0, normalized as 0960 and interpreted as 9 minutes and 60 seconds.\n  The finger moves to 9 (with cost 2), pushes 9 (with cost 1), moves to 6 (with cost 2), pushes 6 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), and pushes 0 (with cost 1).\n  The cost is: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 9.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** startAt = 0, moveCost = 1, pushCost = 2, targetSeconds = 76\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:** The optimal way is to push two digits: 7 6, interpreted as 76 seconds.\nThe finger moves to 7 (with cost 1), pushes 7 (with cost 2), moves to 6 (with cost 1), and pushes 6 (with cost 2). The total cost is: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6\nNote other possible ways are 0076, 076, 0116, and 116, but none of them produces the minimum cost.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `0 <= startAt <= 9`\n*   `1 <= moveCost, pushCost <= 105`\n*   `1 <= targetSeconds <= 6039`",
