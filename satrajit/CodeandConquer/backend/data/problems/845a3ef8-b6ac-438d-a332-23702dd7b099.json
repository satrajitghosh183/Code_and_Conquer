  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` represents the score of the `ith` student. You are also given an integer `k`.\n\nPick the scores of any `k` students from the array so that the **difference** between the **highest** and the **lowest** of the `k` scores is **minimized**.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** possible difference_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[90\\], k = 1\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** There is one way to pick score(s) of one student:\n- \\[**90**\\]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 90 - 90 = 0.\nThe minimum possible difference is 0.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[9,4,1,7\\], k = 2\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** There are six ways to pick score(s) of two students:\n- \\[**9**,**4**,1,7\\]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 4 = 5.\n- \\[**9**,4,**1**,7\\]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 1 = 8.\n- \\[**9**,4,1,**7**\\]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 7 = 2.\n- \\[9,**4**,**1**,7\\]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 4 - 1 = 3.\n- \\[9,**4**,1,**7**\\]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 4 = 3.\n- \\[9,4,**1**,**7**\\]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 1 = 6.\nThe minimum possible difference is 2.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 1000`\n*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 105`",
