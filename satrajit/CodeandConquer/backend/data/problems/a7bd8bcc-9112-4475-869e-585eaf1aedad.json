  "description": "You are given an integer `n` denoting the number of nodes of a **weighted directed** graph. The nodes are numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.\n\nYou are also given a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti]` denotes that there exists a **directed** edge from `fromi` to `toi` with weight `weighti`.\n\nLastly, you are given three **distinct** integers `src1`, `src2`, and `dest` denoting three distinct nodes of the graph.\n\nReturn _the **minimum weight** of a subgraph of the graph such that it is **possible** to reach_ `dest` _from both_ `src1` _and_ `src2` _via a set of edges of this subgraph_. In case such a subgraph does not exist, return `-1`.\n\nA **subgraph** is a graph whose vertices and edges are subsets of the original graph. The **weight** of a subgraph is the sum of weights of its constituent edges.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 6, edges = \\[\\[0,2,2\\],\\[0,5,6\\],\\[1,0,3\\],\\[1,4,5\\],\\[2,1,1\\],\\[2,3,3\\],\\[2,3,4\\],\\[3,4,2\\],\\[4,5,1\\]\\], src1 = 0, src2 = 1, dest = 5\n**Output:** 9\n**Explanation:**\nThe above figure represents the input graph.\nThe blue edges represent one of the subgraphs that yield the optimal answer.\nNote that the subgraph \\[\\[1,0,3\\],\\[0,5,6\\]\\] also yields the optimal answer. It is not possible to get a subgraph with less weight satisfying all the constraints.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 3, edges = \\[\\[0,1,1\\],\\[2,1,1\\]\\], src1 = 0, src2 = 1, dest = 2\n**Output:** -1\n**Explanation:**\nThe above figure represents the input graph.\nIt can be seen that there does not exist any path from node 1 to node 2, hence there are no subgraphs satisfying all the constraints.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `3 <= n <= 105`\n*   `0 <= edges.length <= 105`\n*   `edges[i].length == 3`\n*   `0 <= fromi, toi, src1, src2, dest <= n - 1`\n*   `fromi != toi`\n*   `src1`, `src2`, and `dest` are pairwise distinct.\n*   `1 <= weight[i] <= 105`",
