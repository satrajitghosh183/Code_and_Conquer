  "description": "You want to water `n` plants in your garden with a watering can. The plants are arranged in a row and are labeled from `0` to `n - 1` from left to right where the `ith` plant is located at `x = i`. There is a river at `x = -1` that you can refill your watering can at.\n\nEach plant needs a specific amount of water. You will water the plants in the following way:\n\n*   Water the plants in order from left to right.\n*   After watering the current plant, if you do not have enough water to **completely** water the next plant, return to the river to fully refill the watering can.\n*   You **cannot** refill the watering can early.\n\nYou are initially at the river (i.e., `x = -1`). It takes **one step** to move **one unit** on the x-axis.\n\nGiven a **0-indexed** integer array `plants` of `n` integers, where `plants[i]` is the amount of water the `ith` plant needs, and an integer `capacity` representing the watering can capacity, return _the **number of steps** needed to water all the plants_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** plants = \\[2,2,3,3\\], capacity = 5\n**Output:** 14\n**Explanation:** Start at the river with a full watering can:\n- Walk to plant 0 (1 step) and water it. Watering can has 3 units of water.\n- Walk to plant 1 (1 step) and water it. Watering can has 1 unit of water.\n- Since you cannot completely water plant 2, walk back to the river to refill (2 steps).\n- Walk to plant 2 (3 steps) and water it. Watering can has 2 units of water.\n- Since you cannot completely water plant 3, walk back to the river to refill (3 steps).\n- Walk to plant 3 (4 steps) and water it.\nSteps needed = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 14.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** plants = \\[1,1,1,4,2,3\\], capacity = 4\n**Output:** 30\n**Explanation:** Start at the river with a full watering can:\n- Water plants 0, 1, and 2 (3 steps). Return to river (3 steps).\n- Water plant 3 (4 steps). Return to river (4 steps).\n- Water plant 4 (5 steps). Return to river (5 steps).\n- Water plant 5 (6 steps).\nSteps needed = 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 6 = 30.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** plants = \\[7,7,7,7,7,7,7\\], capacity = 8\n**Output:** 49\n**Explanation:** You have to refill before watering each plant.\nSteps needed = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 7 = 49.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == plants.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 1000`\n*   `1 <= plants[i] <= 106`\n*   `max(plants[i]) <= capacity <= 109`",
