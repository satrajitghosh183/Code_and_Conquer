  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` containing **distinct** numbers, an integer `start`, and an integer `goal`. There is an integer `x` that is initially set to `start`, and you want to perform operations on `x` such that it is converted to `goal`. You can perform the following operation repeatedly on the number `x`:\n\nIf `0 <= x <= 1000`, then for any index `i` in the array (`0 <= i < nums.length`), you can set `x` to any of the following:\n\n*   `x + nums[i]`\n*   `x - nums[i]`\n*   `x ^ nums[i]` (bitwise-XOR)\n\nNote that you can use each `nums[i]` any number of times in any order. Operations that set `x` to be out of the range `0 <= x <= 1000` are valid, but no more operations can be done afterward.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** number of operations needed to convert_ `x = start` _into_ `goal`_, and_ `-1` _if it is not possible_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[2,4,12\\], start = 2, goal = 12\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** We can go from 2 -> 14 -> 12 with the following 2 operations.\n- 2 + 12 = 14\n- 14 - 2 = 12\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[3,5,7\\], start = 0, goal = -4\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** We can go from 0 -> 3 -> -4 with the following 2 operations. \n- 0 + 3 = 3\n- 3 - 7 = -4\nNote that the last operation sets x out of the range 0 <= x <= 1000, which is valid.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[2,8,16\\], start = 0, goal = 1\n**Output:** -1\n**Explanation:** There is no way to convert 0 into 1.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`\n*   `-109 <= nums[i], goal <= 109`\n*   `0 <= start <= 1000`\n*   `start != goal`\n*   All the integers in `nums` are distinct.",
