  "description": "You are given an array of **distinct** positive integers locations where `locations[i]` represents the position of city `i`. You are also given integers `start`, `finish` and `fuel` representing the starting city, ending city, and the initial amount of fuel you have, respectively.\n\nAt each step, if you are at city `i`, you can pick any city `j` such that `j != i` and `0 <= j < locations.length` and move to city `j`. Moving from city `i` to city `j` reduces the amount of fuel you have by `|locations[i] - locations[j]|`. Please notice that `|x|` denotes the absolute value of `x`.\n\nNotice that `fuel` **cannot** become negative at any point in time, and that you are **allowed** to visit any city more than once (including `start` and `finish`).\n\nReturn _the count of all possible routes from_ `start` _to_ `finish`. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** locations = \\[2,3,6,8,4\\], start = 1, finish = 3, fuel = 5\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** The following are all possible routes, each uses 5 units of fuel:\n1 -> 3\n1 -> 2 -> 3\n1 -> 4 -> 3\n1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** locations = \\[4,3,1\\], start = 1, finish = 0, fuel = 6\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** The following are all possible routes:\n1 -> 0, used fuel = 1\n1 -> 2 -> 0, used fuel = 5\n1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 5\n1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 3\n1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 5\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** locations = \\[5,2,1\\], start = 0, finish = 2, fuel = 3\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** It is impossible to get from 0 to 2 using only 3 units of fuel since the shortest route needs 4 units of fuel.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= locations.length <= 100`\n*   `1 <= locations[i] <= 109`\n*   All integers in `locations` are **distinct**.\n*   `0 <= start, finish < locations.length`\n*   `1 <= fuel <= 200`",
