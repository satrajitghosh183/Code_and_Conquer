  "description": "You have a video sharing platform where users can upload and delete videos. Each `video` is a **string** of digits, where the `ith` digit of the string represents the content of the video at minute `i`. For example, the first digit represents the content at minute `0` in the video, the second digit represents the content at minute `1` in the video, and so on. Viewers of videos can also like and dislike videos. Internally, the platform keeps track of the **number of views, likes, and dislikes** on each video.\n\nWhen a video is uploaded, it is associated with the smallest available integer `videoId` starting from `0`. Once a video is deleted, the `videoId` associated with that video can be reused for another video.\n\nImplement the `VideoSharingPlatform` class:\n\n*   `VideoSharingPlatform()` Initializes the object.\n*   `int upload(String video)` The user uploads a `video`. Return the `videoId` associated with the video.\n*   `void remove(int videoId)` If there is a video associated with `videoId`, remove the video.\n*   `String watch(int videoId, int startMinute, int endMinute)` If there is a video associated with `videoId`, increase the number of views on the video by `1` and return the substring of the video string starting at `startMinute` and ending at `min(endMinute, video.length - 1``)` (**inclusive**). Otherwise, return `\"-1 \"`.\n*   `void like(int videoId)` Increases the number of likes on the video associated with `videoId` by `1` if there is a video associated with `videoId`.\n*   `void dislike(int videoId)` Increases the number of dislikes on the video associated with `videoId` by `1` if there is a video associated with `videoId`.\n*   `int[] getLikesAndDislikes(int videoId)` Return a **0-indexed** integer array `values` of length `2` where `values[0]` is the number of likes and `values[1]` is the number of dislikes on the video associated with `videoId`. If there is no video associated with `videoId`, return `[-1]`.\n*   `int getViews(int videoId)` Return the number of views on the video associated with `videoId`, if there is no video associated with `videoId`, return `-1`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input**\n\\[ \"VideoSharingPlatform \",  \"upload \",  \"upload \",  \"remove \",  \"remove \",  \"upload \",  \"watch \",  \"watch \",  \"like \",  \"dislike \",  \"dislike \",  \"getLikesAndDislikes \",  \"getViews \"\\]\n\\[\\[\\], \\[ \"123 \"\\], \\[ \"456 \"\\], \\[4\\], \\[0\\], \\[ \"789 \"\\], \\[1, 0, 5\\], \\[1, 0, 1\\], \\[1\\], \\[1\\], \\[1\\], \\[1\\], \\[1\\]\\]\n**Output**\n\\[null, 0, 1, null, null, 0,  \"456 \",  \"45 \", null, null, null, \\[1, 2\\], 2\\]\n\n**Explanation**\nVideoSharingPlatform videoSharingPlatform = new VideoSharingPlatform();\nvideoSharingPlatform.upload( \"123 \");          // The smallest available videoId is 0, so return 0.\nvideoSharingPlatform.upload( \"456 \");          // The smallest available `videoId` is 1, so return 1.\nvideoSharingPlatform.remove(4);              // There is no video associated with videoId 4, so do nothing.\nvideoSharingPlatform.remove(0);              // Remove the video associated with videoId 0.\nvideoSharingPlatform.upload( \"789 \");          // Since the video associated with videoId 0 was deleted,\n                                             // 0 is the smallest available `videoId`, so return 0.\nvideoSharingPlatform.watch(1, 0, 5);         // The video associated with videoId 1 is  \"456 \".\n                                             // The video from minute 0 to min(5, 3 - 1) = 2 is  \"456 \", so return  \"453 \".\nvideoSharingPlatform.watch(1, 0, 1);         // The video associated with videoId 1 is  \"456 \".\n                                             // The video from minute 0 to min(1, 3 - 1) = 1 is  \"45 \", so return  \"45 \".\nvideoSharingPlatform.like(1);                // Increase the number of likes on the video associated with videoId 1.\nvideoSharingPlatform.dislike(1);             // Increase the number of dislikes on the video associated with videoId 1.\nvideoSharingPlatform.dislike(1);             // Increase the number of dislikes on the video associated with videoId 1.\nvideoSharingPlatform.getLikesAndDislikes(1); // There is 1 like and 2 dislikes on the video associated with videoId 1, so return \\[1, 2\\].\nvideoSharingPlatform.getViews(1);            // The video associated with videoId 1 has 2 views, so return 2.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input**\n\\[ \"VideoSharingPlatform \",  \"remove \",  \"watch \",  \"like \",  \"dislike \",  \"getLikesAndDislikes \",  \"getViews \"\\]\n\\[\\[\\], \\[0\\], \\[0, 0, 1\\], \\[0\\], \\[0\\], \\[0\\], \\[0\\]\\]\n**Output**\n\\[null, null,  \"-1 \", null, null, \\[-1\\], -1\\]\n\n**Explanation**\nVideoSharingPlatform videoSharingPlatform = new VideoSharingPlatform();\nvideoSharingPlatform.remove(0);              // There is no video associated with videoId 0, so do nothing.\nvideoSharingPlatform.watch(0, 0, 1);         // There is no video associated with videoId 0, so return  \"-1 \".\nvideoSharingPlatform.like(0);                // There is no video associated with videoId 0, so do nothing.\nvideoSharingPlatform.dislike(0);             // There is no video associated with videoId 0, so do nothing.\nvideoSharingPlatform.getLikesAndDislikes(0); // There is no video associated with videoId 0, so return \\[-1\\].\nvideoSharingPlatform.getViews(0);            // There is no video associated with videoId 0, so return -1.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= video.length <= 105`\n*   The sum of `video.length` over all calls to `upload` does not exceed `105`\n*   `video` consists of digits.\n*   `0 <= videoId <= 105`\n*   `0 <= startMinute < endMinute < 105`\n*   `startMinute < video.length`\n*   The sum of `endMinute - startMinute` over all calls to `watch` does not exceed `105`.\n*   At most `105` calls **in total** will be made to all functions.",
