  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `tires` where `tires[i] = [fi, ri]` indicates that the `ith` tire can finish its `xth` successive lap in `fi * ri(x-1)` seconds.\n\n*   For example, if `fi = 3` and `ri = 2`, then the tire would finish its `1st` lap in `3` seconds, its `2nd` lap in `3 * 2 = 6` seconds, its `3rd` lap in `3 * 22 = 12` seconds, etc.\n\nYou are also given an integer `changeTime` and an integer `numLaps`.\n\nThe race consists of `numLaps` laps and you may start the race with **any** tire. You have an **unlimited** supply of each tire and after every lap, you may **change** to any given tire (including the current tire type) if you wait `changeTime` seconds.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** time to finish the race._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** tires = \\[\\[2,3\\],\\[3,4\\]\\], changeTime = 5, numLaps = 4\n**Output:** 21\n**Explanation:** \nLap 1: Start with tire 0 and finish the lap in 2 seconds.\nLap 2: Continue with tire 0 and finish the lap in 2 \\* 3 = 6 seconds.\nLap 3: Change tires to a new tire 0 for 5 seconds and then finish the lap in another 2 seconds.\nLap 4: Continue with tire 0 and finish the lap in 2 \\* 3 = 6 seconds.\nTotal time = 2 + 6 + 5 + 2 + 6 = 21 seconds.\nThe minimum time to complete the race is 21 seconds.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** tires = \\[\\[1,10\\],\\[2,2\\],\\[3,4\\]\\], changeTime = 6, numLaps = 5\n**Output:** 25\n**Explanation:** \nLap 1: Start with tire 1 and finish the lap in 2 seconds.\nLap 2: Continue with tire 1 and finish the lap in 2 \\* 2 = 4 seconds.\nLap 3: Change tires to a new tire 1 for 6 seconds and then finish the lap in another 2 seconds.\nLap 4: Continue with tire 1 and finish the lap in 2 \\* 2 = 4 seconds.\nLap 5: Change tires to tire 0 for 6 seconds then finish the lap in another 1 second.\nTotal time = 2 + 4 + 6 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 1 = 25 seconds.\nThe minimum time to complete the race is 25 seconds. \n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= tires.length <= 105`\n*   `tires[i].length == 2`\n*   `1 <= fi, changeTime <= 105`\n*   `2 <= ri <= 105`\n*   `1 <= numLaps <= 1000`",
