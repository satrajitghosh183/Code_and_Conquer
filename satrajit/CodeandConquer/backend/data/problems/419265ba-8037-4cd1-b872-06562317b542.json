  "slug": "build-a-matrix-with-conditions",
  "description": "You are given a **positive** integer `k`. You are also given:\n\n*   a 2D integer array `rowConditions` of size `n` where `rowConditions[i] = [abovei, belowi]`, and\n*   a 2D integer array `colConditions` of size `m` where `colConditions[i] = [lefti, righti]`.\n\nThe two arrays contain integers from `1` to `k`.\n\nYou have to build a `k x k` matrix that contains each of the numbers from `1` to `k` **exactly once**. The remaining cells should have the value `0`.\n\nThe matrix should also satisfy the following conditions:\n\n*   The number `abovei` should appear in a **row** that is strictly **above** the row at which the number `belowi` appears for all `i` from `0` to `n - 1`.\n*   The number `lefti` should appear in a **column** that is strictly **left** of the column at which the number `righti` appears for all `i` from `0` to `m - 1`.\n\nReturn _**any** matrix that satisfies the conditions_. If no answer exists, return an empty matrix.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** k = 3, rowConditions = \\[\\[1,2\\],\\[3,2\\]\\], colConditions = \\[\\[2,1\\],\\[3,2\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[\\[3,0,0\\],\\[0,0,1\\],\\[0,2,0\\]\\]\n**Explanation:** The diagram above shows a valid example of a matrix that satisfies all the conditions.\nThe row conditions are the following:\n- Number 1 is in row 1, and number 2 is in row 2, so 1 is above 2 in the matrix.\n- Number 3 is in row 0, and number 2 is in row 2, so 3 is above 2 in the matrix.\nThe column conditions are the following:\n- Number 2 is in column 1, and number 1 is in column 2, so 2 is left of 1 in the matrix.\n- Number 3 is in column 0, and number 2 is in column 1, so 3 is left of 2 in the matrix.\nNote that there may be multiple correct answers.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** k = 3, rowConditions = \\[\\[1,2\\],\\[2,3\\],\\[3,1\\],\\[2,3\\]\\], colConditions = \\[\\[2,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[\\]\n**Explanation:** From the first two conditions, 3 has to be below 1 but the third conditions needs 3 to be above 1 to be satisfied.\nNo matrix can satisfy all the conditions, so we return the empty matrix.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= k <= 400`\n*   `1 <= rowConditions.length, colConditions.length <= 104`\n*   `rowConditions[i].length == colConditions[i].length == 2`\n*   `1 <= abovei, belowi, lefti, righti <= k`\n*   `abovei != belowi`\n*   `lefti != righti`",
