  "description": "You are the manager of a basketball team. For the upcoming tournament, you want to choose the team with the highest overall score. The score of the team is the **sum** of scores of all the players in the team.\n\nHowever, the basketball team is not allowed to have **conflicts**. A **conflict** exists if a younger player has a **strictly higher** score than an older player. A conflict does **not** occur between players of the same age.\n\nGiven two lists, `scores` and `ages`, where each `scores[i]` and `ages[i]` represents the score and age of the `ith` player, respectively, return _the highest overall score of all possible basketball teams_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** scores = \\[1,3,5,10,15\\], ages = \\[1,2,3,4,5\\]\n**Output:** 34\n**Explanation:** You can choose all the players.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** scores = \\[4,5,6,5\\], ages = \\[2,1,2,1\\]\n**Output:** 16\n**Explanation:** It is best to choose the last 3 players. Notice that you are allowed to choose multiple people of the same age.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** scores = \\[1,2,3,5\\], ages = \\[8,9,10,1\\]\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:** It is best to choose the first 3 players. \n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= scores.length, ages.length <= 1000`\n*   `scores.length == ages.length`\n*   `1 <= scores[i] <= 106`\n*   `1 <= ages[i] <= 1000`",
