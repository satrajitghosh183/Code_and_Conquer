  "description": "A teacher is writing a test with `n` true/false questions, with `'T'` denoting true and `'F'` denoting false. He wants to confuse the students by **maximizing** the number of **consecutive** questions with the **same** answer (multiple trues or multiple falses in a row).\n\nYou are given a string `answerKey`, where `answerKey[i]` is the original answer to the `ith` question. In addition, you are given an integer `k`, the maximum number of times you may perform the following operation:\n\n*   Change the answer key for any question to `'T'` or `'F'` (i.e., set `answerKey[i]` to `'T'` or `'F'`).\n\nReturn _the **maximum** number of consecutive_ `'T'`s or `'F'`s _in the answer key after performing the operation at most_ `k` _times_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** answerKey =  \"TTFF \", k = 2\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** We can replace both the 'F's with 'T's to make answerKey =  \"TTTT \".\nThere are four consecutive 'T's.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** answerKey =  \"TFFT \", k = 1\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** We can replace the first 'T' with an 'F' to make answerKey =  \"FFFT \".\nAlternatively, we can replace the second 'T' with an 'F' to make answerKey =  \"TFFF \".\nIn both cases, there are three consecutive 'F's.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** answerKey =  \"TTFTTFTT \", k = 1\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** We can replace the first 'F' to make answerKey =  \"TTTTTFTT \"\nAlternatively, we can replace the second 'F' to make answerKey =  \"TTFTTTTT \". \nIn both cases, there are five consecutive 'T's.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == answerKey.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 5 * 104`\n*   `answerKey[i]` is either `'T'` or `'F'`\n*   `1 <= k <= n`",
