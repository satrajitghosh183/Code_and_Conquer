  "description": "You are given an integer array `nums`. We call a subset of `nums` **good** if its product can be represented as a product of one or more **distinct prime** numbers.\n\n*   For example, if `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`:\n    *   `[2, 3]`, `[1, 2, 3]`, and `[1, 3]` are **good** subsets with products `6 = 2*3`, `6 = 2*3`, and `3 = 3` respectively.\n    *   `[1, 4]` and `[4]` are not **good** subsets with products `4 = 2*2` and `4 = 2*2` respectively.\n\nReturn _the number of different **good** subsets in_ `nums` _**modulo**_ `109 + 7`.\n\nA **subset** of `nums` is any array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none or all) elements from `nums`. Two subsets are different if and only if the chosen indices to delete are different.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[1,2,3,4\\]\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:** The good subsets are:\n- \\[1,2\\]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.\n- \\[1,2,3\\]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.\n- \\[1,3\\]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.\n- \\[2\\]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.\n- \\[2,3\\]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.\n- \\[3\\]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[4,2,3,15\\]\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** The good subsets are:\n- \\[2\\]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.\n- \\[2,3\\]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.\n- \\[2,15\\]: product is 30, which is the product of distinct primes 2, 3, and 5.\n- \\[3\\]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.\n- \\[15\\]: product is 15, which is the product of distinct primes 3 and 5.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 30`",
