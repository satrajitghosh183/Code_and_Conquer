  "slug": "evaluate-the-bracket-pairs-of-a-string",
  "description": "You are given a string `s` that contains some bracket pairs, with each pair containing a **non-empty** key.\n\n*   For example, in the string `\"(name)is(age)yearsold \"`, there are **two** bracket pairs that contain the keys `\"name \"` and `\"age \"`.\n\nYou know the values of a wide range of keys. This is represented by a 2D string array `knowledge` where each `knowledge[i] = [keyi, valuei]` indicates that key `keyi` has a value of `valuei`.\n\nYou are tasked to evaluate **all** of the bracket pairs. When you evaluate a bracket pair that contains some key `keyi`, you will:\n\n*   Replace `keyi` and the bracket pair with the key's corresponding `valuei`.\n*   If you do not know the value of the key, you will replace `keyi` and the bracket pair with a question mark `\"? \"` (without the quotation marks).\n\nEach key will appear at most once in your `knowledge`. There will not be any nested brackets in `s`.\n\nReturn _the resulting string after evaluating **all** of the bracket pairs._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"(name)is(age)yearsold \", knowledge = \\[\\[ \"name \", \"bob \"\\],\\[ \"age \", \"two \"\\]\\]\n**Output:**  \"bobistwoyearsold \"\n**Explanation:**\nThe key  \"name \" has a value of  \"bob \", so replace  \"(name) \" with  \"bob \".\nThe key  \"age \" has a value of  \"two \", so replace  \"(age) \" with  \"two \".\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"hi(name) \", knowledge = \\[\\[ \"a \", \"b \"\\]\\]\n**Output:**  \"hi? \"\n**Explanation:** As you do not know the value of the key  \"name \", replace  \"(name) \" with  \"? \".\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"(a)(a)(a)aaa \", knowledge = \\[\\[ \"a \", \"yes \"\\]\\]\n**Output:**  \"yesyesyesaaa \"\n**Explanation:** The same key can appear multiple times.\nThe key  \"a \" has a value of  \"yes \", so replace all occurrences of  \"(a) \" with  \"yes \".\nNotice that the  \"a \"s not in a bracket pair are not evaluated.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= s.length <= 105`\n*   `0 <= knowledge.length <= 105`\n*   `knowledge[i].length == 2`\n*   `1 <= keyi.length, valuei.length <= 10`\n*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters and round brackets `'('` and `')'`.\n*   Every open bracket `'('` in `s` will have a corresponding close bracket `')'`.\n*   The key in each bracket pair of `s` will be non-empty.\n*   There will not be any nested bracket pairs in `s`.\n*   `keyi` and `valuei` consist of lowercase English letters.\n*   Each `keyi` in `knowledge` is unique.",
