  "description": "You are given two arrays of positive integers, `boxes` and `warehouse`, representing the heights of some boxes of unit width and the heights of `n` rooms in a warehouse respectively. The warehouse's rooms are labeled from `0` to `n - 1` from left to right where `warehouse[i]` (0-indexed) is the height of the `ith` room.\n\nBoxes are put into the warehouse by the following rules:\n\n*   Boxes cannot be stacked.\n*   You can rearrange the insertion order of the boxes.\n*   Boxes can be pushed into the warehouse from **either side** (left or right)\n*   If the height of some room in the warehouse is less than the height of a box, then that box and all other boxes behind it will be stopped before that room.\n\nReturn _the maximum number of boxes you can put into the warehouse._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** boxes = \\[1,2,2,3,4\\], warehouse = \\[3,4,1,2\\]\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:**\n \nWe can store the boxes in the following order:\n1- Put the yellow box in room 2 from either the left or right side.\n2- Put the orange box in room 3 from the right side.\n3- Put the green box in room 1 from the left side.\n4- Put the red box in room 0 from the left side.\nNotice that there are other valid ways to put 4 boxes such as swapping the red and green boxes or the red and orange boxes.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** boxes = \\[3,5,5,2\\], warehouse = \\[2,1,3,4,5\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:**\n \nIt is not possible to put the two boxes of height 5 in the warehouse since there's only 1 room of height >= 5.\nOther valid solutions are to put the green box in room 2 or to put the orange box first in room 2 before putting the green and red boxes.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == warehouse.length`\n*   `1 <= boxes.length, warehouse.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= boxes[i], warehouse[i] <= 109`",
