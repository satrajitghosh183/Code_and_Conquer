  "description": "On a social network consisting of `m` users and some friendships between users, two users can communicate with each other if they know a common language.\n\nYou are given an integer `n`, an array `languages`, and an array `friendships` where:\n\n*   There are `n` languages numbered `1` through `n`,\n*   `languages[i]` is the set of languages the `i​​​​​​th`​​​​ user knows, and\n*   `friendships[i] = [u​​​​​​i​​​, v​​​​​​i]` denotes a friendship between the users `u​​​​​​​​​​​i`​​​​​ and `vi`.\n\nYou can choose **one** language and teach it to some users so that all friends can communicate with each other. Return _the_ _**minimum**_ _number of users you need to teach._\n\nNote that friendships are not transitive, meaning if `x` is a friend of `y` and `y` is a friend of `z`, this doesn't guarantee that `x` is a friend of `z`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 2, languages = \\[\\[1\\],\\[2\\],\\[1,2\\]\\], friendships = \\[\\[1,2\\],\\[1,3\\],\\[2,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** You can either teach user 1 the second language or user 2 the first language.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 3, languages = \\[\\[2\\],\\[1,3\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[3\\]\\], friendships = \\[\\[1,4\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[3,4\\],\\[2,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** Teach the third language to users 1 and 3, yielding two users to teach.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= n <= 500`\n*   `languages.length == m`\n*   `1 <= m <= 500`\n*   `1 <= languages[i].length <= n`\n*   `1 <= languages[i][j] <= n`\n*   `1 <= u​​​​​​i < v​​​​​​i <= languages.length`\n*   `1 <= friendships.length <= 500`\n*   All tuples `(u​​​​​i, v​​​​​​i)` are unique\n*   `languages[i]` contains only unique values",
