  "description": "There are some prizes on the **X-axis**. You are given an integer array `prizePositions` that is **sorted in non-decreasing order**, where `prizePositions[i]` is the position of the `ith` prize. There could be different prizes at the same position on the line. You are also given an integer `k`.\n\nYou are allowed to select two segments with integer endpoints. The length of each segment must be `k`. You will collect all prizes whose position falls within at least one of the two selected segments (including the endpoints of the segments). The two selected segments may intersect.\n\n*   For example if `k = 2`, you can choose segments `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]`, and you will win any prize i that satisfies `1 <= prizePositions[i] <= 3` or `2 <= prizePositions[i] <= 4`.\n\nReturn _the **maximum** number of prizes you can win if you choose the two segments optimally_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** prizePositions = \\[1,1,2,2,3,3,5\\], k = 2\n**Output:** 7\n**Explanation:** In this example, you can win all 7 prizes by selecting two segments \\[1, 3\\] and \\[3, 5\\].\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** prizePositions = \\[1,2,3,4\\], k = 0\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** For this example, **one choice** for the segments is `[3, 3]` and `[4, 4],` and you will be able to get `2` prizes. \n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= prizePositions.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= prizePositions[i] <= 109`\n*   `0 <= k <= 109`\n*   `prizePositions` is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n.spoilerbutton {display:block; border:dashed; padding: 0px 0px; margin:10px 0px; font-size:150%; font-weight: bold; color:#000000; background-color:cyan; outline:0; } .spoiler {overflow:hidden;} .spoiler > div {-webkit-transition: all 0s ease;-moz-transition: margin 0s ease;-o-transition: all 0s ease;transition: margin 0s ease;} .spoilerbutton\\[value=\"Show Message\"\\] + .spoiler > div {margin-top:-500%;} .spoilerbutton\\[value=\"Hide Message\"\\] + .spoiler {padding:5px;}",
