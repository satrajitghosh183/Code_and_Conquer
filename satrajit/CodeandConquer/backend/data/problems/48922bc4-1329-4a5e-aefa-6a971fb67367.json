  "slug": "maximum-number-of-tasks-you-can-assign",
  "description": "You have `n` tasks and `m` workers. Each task has a strength requirement stored in a **0-indexed** integer array `tasks`, with the `ith` task requiring `tasks[i]` strength to complete. The strength of each worker is stored in a **0-indexed** integer array `workers`, with the `jth` worker having `workers[j]` strength. Each worker can only be assigned to a **single** task and must have a strength **greater than or equal** to the task's strength requirement (i.e., `workers[j] >= tasks[i]`).\n\nAdditionally, you have `pills` magical pills that will **increase a worker's strength** by `strength`. You can decide which workers receive the magical pills, however, you may only give each worker **at most one** magical pill.\n\nGiven the **0-indexed** integer arrays `tasks` and `workers` and the integers `pills` and `strength`, return _the **maximum** number of tasks that can be completed._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** tasks = \\[**3**,**2**,**1**\\], workers = \\[**0**,**3**,**3**\\], pills = 1, strength = 1\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:**\nWe can assign the magical pill and tasks as follows:\n- Give the magical pill to worker 0.\n- Assign worker 0 to task 2 (0 + 1 >= 1)\n- Assign worker 1 to task 1 (3 >= 2)\n- Assign worker 2 to task 0 (3 >= 3)\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** tasks = \\[**5**,4\\], workers = \\[**0**,0,0\\], pills = 1, strength = 5\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:**\nWe can assign the magical pill and tasks as follows:\n- Give the magical pill to worker 0.\n- Assign worker 0 to task 0 (0 + 5 >= 5)\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** tasks = \\[**10**,**15**,30\\], workers = \\[**0**,**10**,10,10,10\\], pills = 3, strength = 10\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:**\nWe can assign the magical pills and tasks as follows:\n- Give the magical pill to worker 0 and worker 1.\n- Assign worker 0 to task 0 (0 + 10 >= 10)\n- Assign worker 1 to task 1 (10 + 10 >= 15)\nThe last pill is not given because it will not make any worker strong enough for the last task.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == tasks.length`\n*   `m == workers.length`\n*   `1 <= n, m <= 5 * 104`\n*   `0 <= pills <= m`\n*   `0 <= tasks[i], workers[j], strength <= 109`",
