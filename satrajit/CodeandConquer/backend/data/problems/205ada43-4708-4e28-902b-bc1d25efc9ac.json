  "description": "You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`​​​, where `m` and `n` are both **even** integers, and an integer `k`.\n\nThe matrix is composed of several layers, which is shown in the below image, where each color is its own layer:\n\nA cyclic rotation of the matrix is done by cyclically rotating **each layer** in the matrix. To cyclically rotate a layer once, each element in the layer will take the place of the adjacent element in the **counter-clockwise** direction. An example rotation is shown below:\n\nReturn _the matrix after applying_ `k` _cyclic rotations to it_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[40,10\\],\\[30,20\\]\\], k = 1\n**Output:** \\[\\[10,20\\],\\[40,30\\]\\]\n**Explanation:** The figures above represent the grid at every state.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[1,2,3,4\\],\\[5,6,7,8\\],\\[9,10,11,12\\],\\[13,14,15,16\\]\\], k = 2\n**Output:** \\[\\[3,4,8,12\\],\\[2,11,10,16\\],\\[1,7,6,15\\],\\[5,9,13,14\\]\\]\n**Explanation:** The figures above represent the grid at every state.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `m == grid.length`\n*   `n == grid[i].length`\n*   `2 <= m, n <= 50`\n*   Both `m` and `n` are **even** integers.\n*   `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 5000`\n*   `1 <= k <= 109`",
