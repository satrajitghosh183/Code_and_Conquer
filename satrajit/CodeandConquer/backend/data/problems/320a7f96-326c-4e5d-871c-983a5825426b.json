  "description": "A farmer has a **rectangular grid** of land with `m` rows and `n` columns that can be divided into unit cells. Each cell is either **fertile** (represented by a `1`) or **barren** (represented by a `0`). All cells outside the grid are considered barren.\n\nA **pyramidal plot** of land can be defined as a set of cells with the following criteria:\n\n1.  The number of cells in the set has to be **greater than** `1` and all cells must be **fertile**.\n2.  The **apex** of a pyramid is the **topmost** cell of the pyramid. The **height** of a pyramid is the number of rows it covers. Let `(r, c)` be the apex of the pyramid, and its height be `h`. Then, the plot comprises of cells `(i, j)` where `r <= i <= r + h - 1` **and** `c - (i - r) <= j <= c + (i - r)`.\n\nAn **inverse pyramidal plot** of land can be defined as a set of cells with similar criteria:\n\n1.  The number of cells in the set has to be **greater than** `1` and all cells must be **fertile**.\n2.  The **apex** of an inverse pyramid is the **bottommost** cell of the inverse pyramid. The **height** of an inverse pyramid is the number of rows it covers. Let `(r, c)` be the apex of the pyramid, and its height be `h`. Then, the plot comprises of cells `(i, j)` where `r - h + 1 <= i <= r` **and** `c - (r - i) <= j <= c + (r - i)`.\n\nSome examples of valid and invalid pyramidal (and inverse pyramidal) plots are shown below. Black cells indicate fertile cells.\n\nGiven a **0-indexed** `m x n` binary matrix `grid` representing the farmland, return _the **total number** of pyramidal and inverse pyramidal plots that can be found in_ `grid`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[0,1,1,0\\],\\[1,1,1,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** The 2 possible pyramidal plots are shown in blue and red respectively.\nThere are no inverse pyramidal plots in this grid. \nHence total number of pyramidal and inverse pyramidal plots is 2 + 0 = 2.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[1,1,1\\],\\[1,1,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** The pyramidal plot is shown in blue, and the inverse pyramidal plot is shown in red. \nHence the total number of plots is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[1,1,1,1,0\\],\\[1,1,1,1,1\\],\\[1,1,1,1,1\\],\\[0,1,0,0,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** 13\n**Explanation:** There are 7 pyramidal plots, 3 of which are shown in the 2nd and 3rd figures.\nThere are 6 inverse pyramidal plots, 2 of which are shown in the last figure.\nThe total number of plots is 7 + 6 = 13.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `m == grid.length`\n*   `n == grid[i].length`\n*   `1 <= m, n <= 1000`\n*   `1 <= m * n <= 105`\n*   `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.",
