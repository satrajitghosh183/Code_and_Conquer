  "description": "You are given an array `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on an **X-Y** plane.\n\n**Straight lines** are going to be added to the **X-Y** plane, such that every point is covered by at **least** one line.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** number of **straight lines** needed to cover all the points_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** points = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[2,3\\],\\[4,5\\],\\[4,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** The minimum number of straight lines needed is two. One possible solution is to add:\n- One line connecting the point at (0, 1) to the point at (4, 5).\n- Another line connecting the point at (2, 3) to the point at (4, 3).\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** points = \\[\\[0,2\\],\\[-2,-2\\],\\[1,4\\]\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** The minimum number of straight lines needed is one. The only solution is to add:\n- One line connecting the point at (-2, -2) to the point at (1, 4).\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= points.length <= 10`\n*   `points[i].length == 2`\n*   `-100 <= xi, yi <= 100`\n*   All the `points` are **unique**.",
