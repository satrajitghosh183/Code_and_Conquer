  "description": "You are given an array `pairs`, where `pairs[i] = [xi, yi]`, and:\n\n*   There are no duplicates.\n*   `xi < yi`\n\nLet `ways` be the number of rooted trees that satisfy the following conditions:\n\n*   The tree consists of nodes whose values appeared in `pairs`.\n*   A pair `[xi, yi]` exists in `pairs` **if and only if** `xi` is an ancestor of `yi` or `yi` is an ancestor of `xi`.\n*   **Note:** the tree does not have to be a binary tree.\n\nTwo ways are considered to be different if there is at least one node that has different parents in both ways.\n\nReturn:\n\n*   `0` if `ways == 0`\n*   `1` if `ways == 1`\n*   `2` if `ways > 1`\n\nA **rooted tree** is a tree that has a single root node, and all edges are oriented to be outgoing from the root.\n\nAn **ancestor** of a node is any node on the path from the root to that node (excluding the node itself). The root has no ancestors.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** pairs = \\[\\[1,2\\],\\[2,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** There is exactly one valid rooted tree, which is shown in the above figure.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** pairs = \\[\\[1,2\\],\\[2,3\\],\\[1,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** There are multiple valid rooted trees. Three of them are shown in the above figures.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** pairs = \\[\\[1,2\\],\\[2,3\\],\\[2,4\\],\\[1,5\\]\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** There are no valid rooted trees.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= pairs.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= xi < yi <= 500`\n*   The elements in `pairs` are unique.",
