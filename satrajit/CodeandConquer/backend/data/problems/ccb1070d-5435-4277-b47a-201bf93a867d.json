  "description": "You are playing a video game where you are defending your city from a group of `n` monsters. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `dist` of size `n`, where `dist[i]` is the **initial distance** in kilometers of the `ith` monster from the city.\n\nThe monsters walk toward the city at a **constant** speed. The speed of each monster is given to you in an integer array `speed` of size `n`, where `speed[i]` is the speed of the `ith` monster in kilometers per minute.\n\nYou have a weapon that, once fully charged, can eliminate a **single** monster. However, the weapon takes **one minute** to charge.The weapon is fully charged at the very start.\n\nYou lose when any monster reaches your city. If a monster reaches the city at the exact moment the weapon is fully charged, it counts as a **loss**, and the game ends before you can use your weapon.\n\nReturn _the **maximum** number of monsters that you can eliminate before you lose, or_ `n` _if you can eliminate all the monsters before they reach the city._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** dist = \\[1,3,4\\], speed = \\[1,1,1\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:**\nIn the beginning, the distances of the monsters are \\[1,3,4\\]. You eliminate the first monster.\nAfter a minute, the distances of the monsters are \\[X,2,3\\]. You eliminate the second monster.\nAfter a minute, the distances of the monsters are \\[X,X,2\\]. You eliminate the thrid monster.\nAll 3 monsters can be eliminated.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** dist = \\[1,1,2,3\\], speed = \\[1,1,1,1\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:**\nIn the beginning, the distances of the monsters are \\[1,1,2,3\\]. You eliminate the first monster.\nAfter a minute, the distances of the monsters are \\[X,0,1,2\\], so you lose.\nYou can only eliminate 1 monster.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** dist = \\[3,2,4\\], speed = \\[5,3,2\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:**\nIn the beginning, the distances of the monsters are \\[3,2,4\\]. You eliminate the first monster.\nAfter a minute, the distances of the monsters are \\[X,0,2\\], so you lose.\nYou can only eliminate 1 monster.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == dist.length == speed.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 105`\n*   `1 <= dist[i], speed[i] <= 105`",
