  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** array of strings `words`. Each string consists of **lowercase English letters** only. No letter occurs more than once in any string of `words`.\n\nTwo strings `s1` and `s2` are said to be **connected** if the set of letters of `s2` can be obtained from the set of letters of `s1` by any **one** of the following operations:\n\n*   Adding exactly one letter to the set of the letters of `s1`.\n*   Deleting exactly one letter from the set of the letters of `s1`.\n*   Replacing exactly one letter from the set of the letters of `s1` with any letter, **including** itself.\n\nThe array `words` can be divided into one or more non-intersecting **groups**. A string belongs to a group if any **one** of the following is true:\n\n*   It is connected to **at least one** other string of the group.\n*   It is the **only** string present in the group.\n\nNote that the strings in `words` should be grouped in such a manner that a string belonging to a group cannot be connected to a string present in any other group. It can be proved that such an arrangement is always unique.\n\nReturn _an array_ `ans` _of size_ `2` _where:_\n\n*   `ans[0]` _is the **maximum number** of groups_ `words` _can be divided into, and_\n*   `ans[1]` _is the **size of the largest** group_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** words = \\[ \"a \", \"b \", \"ab \", \"cde \"\\]\n**Output:** \\[2,3\\]\n**Explanation:**\n- words\\[0\\] can be used to obtain words\\[1\\] (by replacing 'a' with 'b'), and words\\[2\\] (by adding 'b'). So words\\[0\\] is connected to words\\[1\\] and words\\[2\\].\n- words\\[1\\] can be used to obtain words\\[0\\] (by replacing 'b' with 'a'), and words\\[2\\] (by adding 'a'). So words\\[1\\] is connected to words\\[0\\] and words\\[2\\].\n- words\\[2\\] can be used to obtain words\\[0\\] (by deleting 'b'), and words\\[1\\] (by deleting 'a'). So words\\[2\\] is connected to words\\[0\\] and words\\[1\\].\n- words\\[3\\] is not connected to any string in words.\nThus, words can be divided into 2 groups \\[ \"a \", \"b \", \"ab \"\\] and \\[ \"cde \"\\]. The size of the largest group is 3.  \n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** words = \\[ \"a \", \"ab \", \"abc \"\\]\n**Output:** \\[1,3\\]\n**Explanation:**\n- words\\[0\\] is connected to words\\[1\\].\n- words\\[1\\] is connected to words\\[0\\] and words\\[2\\].\n- words\\[2\\] is connected to words\\[1\\].\nSince all strings are connected to each other, they should be grouped together.\nThus, the size of the largest group is 3.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= words.length <= 2 * 104`\n*   `1 <= words[i].length <= 26`\n*   `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters only.\n*   No letter occurs more than once in `words[i]`.",
