  "description": "You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays of the same length `present` and `future` where `present[i]` is the current price of the `ith` stock and `future[i]` is the price of the `ith` stock a year in the future. You may buy each stock at most **once**. You are also given an integer `budget` representing the amount of money you currently have.\n\nReturn _the maximum amount of profit you can make._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** present = \\[5,4,6,2,3\\], future = \\[8,5,4,3,5\\], budget = 10\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:** One possible way to maximize your profit is to:\nBuy the 0th, 3rd, and 4th stocks for a total of 5 + 2 + 3 = 10.\nNext year, sell all three stocks for a total of 8 + 3 + 5 = 16.\nThe profit you made is 16 - 10 = 6.\nIt can be shown that the maximum profit you can make is 6.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** present = \\[2,2,5\\], future = \\[3,4,10\\], budget = 6\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** The only possible way to maximize your profit is to:\nBuy the 2nd stock, and make a profit of 10 - 5 = 5.\nIt can be shown that the maximum profit you can make is 5.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** present = \\[3,3,12\\], future = \\[0,3,15\\], budget = 10\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** One possible way to maximize your profit is to:\nBuy the 1st stock, and make a profit of 3 - 3 = 0.\nIt can be shown that the maximum profit you can make is 0.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == present.length == future.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 1000`\n*   `0 <= present[i], future[i] <= 100`\n*   `0 <= budget <= 1000`",
