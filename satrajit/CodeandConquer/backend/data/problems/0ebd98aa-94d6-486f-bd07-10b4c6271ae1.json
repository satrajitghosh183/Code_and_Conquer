  "slug": "find-the-substring-with-maximum-cost",
  "description": "You are given a string `s`, a string `chars` of **distinct** characters and an integer array `vals` of the same length as `chars`.\n\nThe **cost of the substring** is the sum of the values of each character in the substring. The cost of an empty string is considered `0`.\n\nThe **value of the character** is defined in the following way:\n\n*   If the character is not in the string `chars`, then its value is its corresponding position **(1-indexed)** in the alphabet.\n    *   For example, the value of `'a'` is `1`, the value of `'b'` is `2`, and so on. The value of `'z'` is `26`.\n*   Otherwise, assuming `i` is the index where the character occurs in the string `chars`, then its value is `vals[i]`.\n\nReturn _the maximum cost among all substrings of the string_ `s`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"adaa \", chars =  \"d \", vals = \\[-1000\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** The value of the characters  \"a \" and  \"d \" is 1 and -1000 respectively.\nThe substring with the maximum cost is  \"aa \" and its cost is 1 + 1 = 2.\nIt can be proven that 2 is the maximum cost.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"abc \", chars =  \"abc \", vals = \\[-1,-1,-1\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** The value of the characters  \"a \",  \"b \" and  \"c \" is -1, -1, and -1 respectively.\nThe substring with the maximum cost is the empty substring  \" \" and its cost is 0.\nIt can be proven that 0 is the maximum cost.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= s.length <= 105`\n*   `s` consist of lowercase English letters.\n*   `1 <= chars.length <= 26`\n*   `chars` consist of **distinct** lowercase English letters.\n*   `vals.length == chars.length`\n*   `-1000 <= vals[i] <= 1000`",
