  "description": "You are given an integer array `nums`.\n\nIn one move, you can choose one element of `nums` and change it to **any value**.\n\nReturn _the minimum difference between the largest and smallest value of `nums` **after performing at most three moves**_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[5,3,2,4\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** We can make at most 3 moves.\nIn the first move, change 2 to 3. nums becomes \\[5,3,3,4\\].\nIn the second move, change 4 to 3. nums becomes \\[5,3,3,3\\].\nIn the third move, change 5 to 3. nums becomes \\[3,3,3,3\\].\nAfter performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 3 - 3 = 0.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[1,5,0,10,14\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** We can make at most 3 moves.\nIn the first move, change 5 to 0. nums becomes \\[1,0,0,10,14\\].\nIn the second move, change 10 to 0. nums becomes \\[1,0,0,0,14\\].\nIn the third move, change 14 to 1. nums becomes \\[1,0,0,0,1\\].\nAfter performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 1 - 0 = 0.\nIt can be shown that there is no way to make the difference 0 in 3 moves.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[3,100,20\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** We can make at most 3 moves.\nIn the first move, change 100 to 7. nums becomes \\[4,7,20\\].\nIn the second move, change 20 to 7. nums becomes \\[4,7,7\\].\nIn the third move, change 4 to 3. nums becomes \\[7,7,7\\].\nAfter performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 7 - 7 = 0.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`\n*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`",
