  "description": "You are given an integer array `cards` where `cards[i]` represents the **value** of the `ith` card. A pair of cards are **matching** if the cards have the **same** value.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** number of **consecutive** cards you have to pick up to have a pair of **matching** cards among the picked cards._ If it is impossible to have matching cards, return `-1`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** cards = \\[3,4,2,3,4,7\\]\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** We can pick up the cards \\[3,4,2,3\\] which contain a matching pair of cards with value 3. Note that picking up the cards \\[4,2,3,4\\] is also optimal.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** cards = \\[1,0,5,3\\]\n**Output:** -1\n**Explanation:** There is no way to pick up a set of consecutive cards that contain a pair of matching cards.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= cards.length <= 105`\n*   `0 <= cards[i] <= 106`",
