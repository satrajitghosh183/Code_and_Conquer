  "description": "There is an undirected connected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and `n - 1` edges.\n\nYou are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n` where `nums[i]` represents the value of the `ith` node. You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree.\n\nRemove two **distinct** edges of the tree to form three connected components. For a pair of removed edges, the following steps are defined:\n\n1.  Get the XOR of all the values of the nodes for **each** of the three components respectively.\n2.  The **difference** between the **largest** XOR value and the **smallest** XOR value is the **score** of the pair.\n\n*   For example, say the three components have the node values: `[4,5,7]`, `[1,9]`, and `[3,3,3]`. The three XOR values are `4 ^ 5 ^ 7 = **6**`, `1 ^ 9 = **8**`, and `3 ^ 3 ^ 3 = **3**`. The largest XOR value is `8` and the smallest XOR value is `3`. The score is then `8 - 3 = 5`.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** score of any possible pair of edge removals on the given tree_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[1,5,5,4,11\\], edges = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[1,3\\],\\[3,4\\]\\]\n**Output:** 9\n**Explanation:** The diagram above shows a way to make a pair of removals.\n- The 1st component has nodes \\[1,3,4\\] with values \\[5,4,11\\]. Its XOR value is 5 ^ 4 ^ 11 = 10.\n- The 2nd component has node \\[0\\] with value \\[1\\]. Its XOR value is 1 = 1.\n- The 3rd component has node \\[2\\] with value \\[5\\]. Its XOR value is 5 = 5.\nThe score is the difference between the largest and smallest XOR value which is 10 - 1 = 9.\nIt can be shown that no other pair of removals will obtain a smaller score than 9.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[5,5,2,4,4,2\\], edges = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[5,2\\],\\[4,3\\],\\[1,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** The diagram above shows a way to make a pair of removals.\n- The 1st component has nodes \\[3,4\\] with values \\[4,4\\]. Its XOR value is 4 ^ 4 = 0.\n- The 2nd component has nodes \\[1,0\\] with values \\[5,5\\]. Its XOR value is 5 ^ 5 = 0.\n- The 3rd component has nodes \\[2,5\\] with values \\[2,2\\]. Its XOR value is 2 ^ 2 = 0.\nThe score is the difference between the largest and smallest XOR value which is 0 - 0 = 0.\nWe cannot obtain a smaller score than 0.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == nums.length`\n*   `3 <= n <= 1000`\n*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 108`\n*   `edges.length == n - 1`\n*   `edges[i].length == 2`\n*   `0 <= ai, bi < n`\n*   `ai != bi`\n*   `edges` represents a valid tree.",
