  "description": "You are given a string `s` of length `n`, and an integer `k`. You are tasked to find the **longest subsequence repeated** `k` times in string `s`.\n\nA **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.\n\nA subsequence `seq` is **repeated** `k` times in the string `s` if `seq * k` is a subsequence of `s`, where `seq * k` represents a string constructed by concatenating `seq` `k` times.\n\n*   For example, `\"bba \"` is repeated `2` times in the string `\"bababcba \"`, because the string `\"bbabba \"`, constructed by concatenating `\"bba \"` `2` times, is a subsequence of the string `\"**b**a**bab**c**ba** \"`.\n\nReturn _the **longest subsequence repeated**_ `k` _times in string_ `s`_. If multiple such subsequences are found, return the **lexicographically largest** one. If there is no such subsequence, return an **empty** string_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"letsleetcode \", k = 2\n**Output:**  \"let \"\n**Explanation:** There are two longest subsequences repeated 2 times:  \"let \" and  \"ete \".\n \"let \" is the lexicographically largest one.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"bb \", k = 2\n**Output:**  \"b \"\n**Explanation:** The longest subsequence repeated 2 times is  \"b \".\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"ab \", k = 2\n**Output:**  \" \"\n**Explanation:** There is no subsequence repeated 2 times. Empty string is returned.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == s.length`\n*   `2 <= n, k <= 2000`\n*   `2 <= n < k * 8`\n*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters.",
