  "title": "Subsequence With the Minimum Score",
  "slug": "subsequence-with-the-minimum-score",
  "description": "You are given two strings `s` and `t`.\n\nYou are allowed to remove any number of characters from the string `t`.\n\nThe score of the string is `0` if no characters are removed from the string `t`, otherwise:\n\n*   Let `left` be the minimum index among all removed characters.\n*   Let `right` be the maximum index among all removed characters.\n\nThen the score of the string is `right - left + 1`.\n\nReturn _the minimum possible score to make_ `t` _a subsequence of_ `s`_._\n\nA **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `\"ace \"` is a subsequence of `\"abcde \"` while `\"aec \"` is not).\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"abacaba \", t =  \"bzaa \"\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** In this example, we remove the character  \"z \" at index 1 (0-indexed).\nThe string t becomes  \"baa \" which is a subsequence of the string  \"abacaba \" and the score is 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.\nIt can be proven that 1 is the minimum score that we can achieve.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"cde \", t =  \"xyz \"\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** In this example, we remove characters  \"x \",  \"y \" and  \"z \" at indices 0, 1, and 2 (0-indexed).\nThe string t becomes  \" \" which is a subsequence of the string  \"cde \" and the score is 2 - 0 + 1 = 3.\nIt can be proven that 3 is the minimum score that we can achieve.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 105`\n*   `s` and `t` consist of only lowercase English letters.",
