  "description": "You are entering a competition, and are given two **positive** integers `initialEnergy` and `initialExperience` denoting your initial energy and initial experience respectively.\n\nYou are also given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `energy` and `experience`, both of length `n`.\n\nYou will face `n` opponents **in order**. The energy and experience of the `ith` opponent is denoted by `energy[i]` and `experience[i]` respectively. When you face an opponent, you need to have both **strictly** greater experience and energy to defeat them and move to the next opponent if available.\n\nDefeating the `ith` opponent **increases** your experience by `experience[i]`, but **decreases** your energy by `energy[i]`.\n\nBefore starting the competition, you can train for some number of hours. After each hour of training, you can **either** choose to increase your initial experience by one, or increase your initial energy by one.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** number of training hours required to defeat all_ `n` _opponents_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** initialEnergy = 5, initialExperience = 3, energy = \\[1,4,3,2\\], experience = \\[2,6,3,1\\]\n**Output:** 8\n**Explanation:** You can increase your energy to 11 after 6 hours of training, and your experience to 5 after 2 hours of training.\nYou face the opponents in the following order:\n- You have more energy and experience than the 0th opponent so you win.\n  Your energy becomes 11 - 1 = 10, and your experience becomes 5 + 2 = 7.\n- You have more energy and experience than the 1st opponent so you win.\n  Your energy becomes 10 - 4 = 6, and your experience becomes 7 + 6 = 13.\n- You have more energy and experience than the 2nd opponent so you win.\n  Your energy becomes 6 - 3 = 3, and your experience becomes 13 + 3 = 16.\n- You have more energy and experience than the 3rd opponent so you win.\n  Your energy becomes 3 - 2 = 1, and your experience becomes 16 + 1 = 17.\nYou did a total of 6 + 2 = 8 hours of training before the competition, so we return 8.\nIt can be proven that no smaller answer exists.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** initialEnergy = 2, initialExperience = 4, energy = \\[1\\], experience = \\[3\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** You do not need any additional energy or experience to win the competition, so we return 0.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == energy.length == experience.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 100`\n*   `1 <= initialEnergy, initialExperience, energy[i], experience[i] <= 100`",
