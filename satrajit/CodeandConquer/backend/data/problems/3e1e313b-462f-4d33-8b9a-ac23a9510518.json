  "description": "You are given two strings `s` and `p` where `p` is a **subsequence** of `s`. You are also given a **distinct 0-indexed** integer array `removable` containing a subset of indices of `s` (`s` is also **0-indexed**).\n\nYou want to choose an integer `k` (`0 <= k <= removable.length`) such that, after removing `k` characters from `s` using the **first** `k` indices in `removable`, `p` is still a **subsequence** of `s`. More formally, you will mark the character at `s[removable[i]]` for each `0 <= i < k`, then remove all marked characters and check if `p` is still a subsequence.\n\nReturn _the **maximum**_ `k` _you can choose such that_ `p` _is still a **subsequence** of_ `s` _after the removals_.\n\nA **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"abcacb \", p =  \"ab \", removable = \\[3,1,0\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation**: After removing the characters at indices 3 and 1,  \"a**b**c**a**cb \" becomes  \"accb \".\n \"ab \" is a subsequence of  \"**a**cc**b** \".\nIf we remove the characters at indices 3, 1, and 0,  \"**ab**c**a**cb \" becomes  \"ccb \", and  \"ab \" is no longer a subsequence.\nHence, the maximum k is 2.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"abcbddddd \", p =  \"abcd \", removable = \\[3,2,1,4,5,6\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation**: After removing the character at index 3,  \"abc**b**ddddd \" becomes  \"abcddddd \".\n \"abcd \" is a subsequence of  \"**abcd**dddd \".\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"abcab \", p =  \"abc \", removable = \\[0,1,2,3,4\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation**: If you remove the first index in the array removable,  \"abc \" is no longer a subsequence.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= p.length <= s.length <= 105`\n*   `0 <= removable.length < s.length`\n*   `0 <= removable[i] < s.length`\n*   `p` is a **subsequence** of `s`.\n*   `s` and `p` both consist of lowercase English letters.\n*   The elements in `removable` are **distinct**.",
