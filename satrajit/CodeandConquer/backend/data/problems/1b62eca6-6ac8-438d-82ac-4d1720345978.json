  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n`.\n\nYou can perform the following operation as many times as you want:\n\n*   Pick an index `i` that you haven't picked before, and pick a prime `p` **strictly less than** `nums[i]`, then subtract `p` from `nums[i]`.\n\nReturn _true if you can make `nums` a strictly increasing array using the above operation and false otherwise._\n\nA **strictly increasing array** is an array whose each element is strictly greater than its preceding element.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[4,9,6,10\\]\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:** In the first operation: Pick i = 0 and p = 3, and then subtract 3 from nums\\[0\\], so that nums becomes \\[1,9,6,10\\].\nIn the second operation: i = 1, p = 7, subtract 7 from nums\\[1\\], so nums becomes equal to \\[1,2,6,10\\].\nAfter the second operation, nums is sorted in strictly increasing order, so the answer is true.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[6,8,11,12\\]\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:** Initially nums is sorted in strictly increasing order, so we don't need to make any operations.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[5,8,3\\]\n**Output:** false\n**Explanation:** It can be proven that there is no way to perform operations to make nums sorted in strictly increasing order, so the answer is false.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`\n*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`\n*   `nums.length == n`",
