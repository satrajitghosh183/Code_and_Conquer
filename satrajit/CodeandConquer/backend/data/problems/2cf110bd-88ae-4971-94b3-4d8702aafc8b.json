  "slug": "add-minimum-number-of-rungs",
  "description": "You are given a **strictly increasing** integer array `rungs` that represents the **height** of rungs on a ladder. You are currently on the **floor** at height `0`, and you want to reach the last rung.\n\nYou are also given an integer `dist`. You can only climb to the next highest rung if the distance between where you are currently at (the floor or on a rung) and the next rung is **at most** `dist`. You are able to insert rungs at any positive **integer** height if a rung is not already there.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** number of rungs that must be added to the ladder in order for you to climb to the last rung._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** rungs = \\[1,3,5,10\\], dist = 2\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:**\nYou currently cannot reach the last rung.\nAdd rungs at heights 7 and 8 to climb this ladder. \nThe ladder will now have rungs at \\[1,3,5,7,8,10\\].\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** rungs = \\[3,6,8,10\\], dist = 3\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:**\nThis ladder can be climbed without adding additional rungs.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** rungs = \\[3,4,6,7\\], dist = 2\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:**\nYou currently cannot reach the first rung from the ground.\nAdd a rung at height 1 to climb this ladder.\nThe ladder will now have rungs at \\[1,3,4,6,7\\].\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= rungs.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= rungs[i] <= 109`\n*   `1 <= dist <= 109`\n*   `rungs` is **strictly increasing**.",
