  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** binary string `s` which represents a sequence of train cars. `s[i] = '0'` denotes that the `ith` car does **not** contain illegal goods and `s[i] = '1'` denotes that the `ith` car does contain illegal goods.\n\nAs the train conductor, you would like to get rid of all the cars containing illegal goods. You can do any of the following three operations **any** number of times:\n\n1.  Remove a train car from the **left** end (i.e., remove `s[0]`) which takes 1 unit of time.\n2.  Remove a train car from the **right** end (i.e., remove `s[s.length - 1]`) which takes 1 unit of time.\n3.  Remove a train car from **anywhere** in the sequence which takes 2 units of time.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** time to remove all the cars containing illegal goods_.\n\nNote that an empty sequence of cars is considered to have no cars containing illegal goods.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"**11**00**1**0**1** \"\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** \nOne way to remove all the cars containing illegal goods from the sequence is to\n- remove a car from the left end 2 times. Time taken is 2 \\* 1 = 2.\n- remove a car from the right end. Time taken is 1.\n- remove the car containing illegal goods found in the middle. Time taken is 2.\nThis obtains a total time of 2 + 1 + 2 = 5. \n\nAn alternative way is to\n- remove a car from the left end 2 times. Time taken is 2 \\* 1 = 2.\n- remove a car from the right end 3 times. Time taken is 3 \\* 1 = 3.\nThis also obtains a total time of 2 + 3 = 5.\n\n5 is the minimum time taken to remove all the cars containing illegal goods. \nThere are no other ways to remove them with less time.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"00**1**0 \"\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:**\nOne way to remove all the cars containing illegal goods from the sequence is to\n- remove a car from the left end 3 times. Time taken is 3 \\* 1 = 3.\nThis obtains a total time of 3.\n\nAnother way to remove all the cars containing illegal goods from the sequence is to\n- remove the car containing illegal goods found in the middle. Time taken is 2.\nThis obtains a total time of 2.\n\nAnother way to remove all the cars containing illegal goods from the sequence is to \n- remove a car from the right end 2 times. Time taken is 2 \\* 1 = 2. \nThis obtains a total time of 2.\n\n2 is the minimum time taken to remove all the cars containing illegal goods. \nThere are no other ways to remove them with less time.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105`\n*   `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.",
