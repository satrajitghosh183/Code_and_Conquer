  "description": "There are `n` points on a road you are driving your taxi on. The `n` points on the road are labeled from `1` to `n` in the direction you are going, and you want to drive from point `1` to point `n` to make money by picking up passengers. You cannot change the direction of the taxi.\n\nThe passengers are represented by a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `rides`, where `rides[i] = [starti, endi, tipi]` denotes the `ith` passenger requesting a ride from point `starti` to point `endi` who is willing to give a `tipi` dollar tip.\n\nFor **each** passenger `i` you pick up, you **earn** `endi - starti + tipi` dollars. You may only drive **at most one** passenger at a time.\n\nGiven `n` and `rides`, return _the **maximum** number of dollars you can earn by picking up the passengers optimally._\n\n**Note:** You may drop off a passenger and pick up a different passenger at the same point.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 5, rides = \\[\\[2,5,4\\],\\[1,5,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** 7\n**Explanation:** We can pick up passenger 0 to earn 5 - 2 + 4 = 7 dollars.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 20, rides = \\[\\[1,6,1\\],\\[3,10,2\\],\\[10,12,3\\],\\[11,12,2\\],\\[12,15,2\\],\\[13,18,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** 20\n**Explanation:** We will pick up the following passengers:\n- Drive passenger 1 from point 3 to point 10 for a profit of 10 - 3 + 2 = 9 dollars.\n- Drive passenger 2 from point 10 to point 12 for a profit of 12 - 10 + 3 = 5 dollars.\n- Drive passenger 5 from point 13 to point 18 for a profit of 18 - 13 + 1 = 6 dollars.\nWe earn 9 + 5 + 6 = 20 dollars in total.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= n <= 105`\n*   `1 <= rides.length <= 3 * 104`\n*   `rides[i].length == 3`\n*   `1 <= starti < endi <= n`\n*   `1 <= tipi <= 105`",
