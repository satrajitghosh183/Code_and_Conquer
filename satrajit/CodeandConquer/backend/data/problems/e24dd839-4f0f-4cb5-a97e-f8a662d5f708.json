  "description": "You are given two string arrays `positive_feedback` and `negative_feedback`, containing the words denoting positive and negative feedback, respectively. Note that **no** word is both positive and negative.\n\nInitially every student has `0` points. Each positive word in a feedback report **increases** the points of a student by `3`, whereas each negative word **decreases** the points by `1`.\n\nYou are given `n` feedback reports, represented by a **0-indexed** string array `report` and a **0-indexed** integer array `student_id`, where `student_id[i]` represents the ID of the student who has received the feedback report `report[i]`. The ID of each student is **unique**.\n\nGiven an integer `k`, return _the top_ `k` _students after ranking them in **non-increasing** order by their points_. In case more than one student has the same points, the one with the lower ID ranks higher.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** positive\\_feedback = \\[ \"smart \", \"brilliant \", \"studious \"\\], negative\\_feedback = \\[ \"not \"\\], report = \\[ \"this student is studious \", \"the student is smart \"\\], student\\_id = \\[1,2\\], k = 2\n**Output:** \\[1,2\\]\n**Explanation:** \nBoth the students have 1 positive feedback and 3 points but since student 1 has a lower ID he ranks higher.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** positive\\_feedback = \\[ \"smart \", \"brilliant \", \"studious \"\\], negative\\_feedback = \\[ \"not \"\\], report = \\[ \"this student is not studious \", \"the student is smart \"\\], student\\_id = \\[1,2\\], k = 2\n**Output:** \\[2,1\\]\n**Explanation:** \n- The student with ID 1 has 1 positive feedback and 1 negative feedback, so he has 3-1=2 points. \n- The student with ID 2 has 1 positive feedback, so he has 3 points. \nSince student 2 has more points, \\[2,1\\] is returned.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= positive_feedback.length, negative_feedback.length <= 104`\n*   `1 <= positive_feedback[i].length, negative_feedback[j].length <= 100`\n*   Both `positive_feedback[i]` and `negative_feedback[j]` consists of lowercase English letters.\n*   No word is present in both `positive_feedback` and `negative_feedback`.\n*   `n == report.length == student_id.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 104`\n*   `report[i]` consists of lowercase English letters and spaces `' '`.\n*   There is a single space between consecutive words of `report[i]`.\n*   `1 <= report[i].length <= 100`\n*   `1 <= student_id[i] <= 109`\n*   All the values of `student_id[i]` are **unique**.\n*   `1 <= k <= n`",
