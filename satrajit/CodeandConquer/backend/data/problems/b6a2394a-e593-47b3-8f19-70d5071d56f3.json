  "description": "You are given a 2D integer array `intervals`, where `intervals[i] = [lefti, righti]` describes the `ith` interval starting at `lefti` and ending at `righti` **(inclusive)**. The **size** of an interval is defined as the number of integers it contains, or more formally `righti - lefti + 1`.\n\nYou are also given an integer array `queries`. The answer to the `jth` query is the **size of the smallest interval** `i` such that `lefti <= queries[j] <= righti`. If no such interval exists, the answer is `-1`.\n\nReturn _an array containing the answers to the queries_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** intervals = \\[\\[1,4\\],\\[2,4\\],\\[3,6\\],\\[4,4\\]\\], queries = \\[2,3,4,5\\]\n**Output:** \\[3,3,1,4\\]\n**Explanation:** The queries are processed as follows:\n- Query = 2: The interval \\[2,4\\] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.\n- Query = 3: The interval \\[2,4\\] is the smallest interval containing 3. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.\n- Query = 4: The interval \\[4,4\\] is the smallest interval containing 4. The answer is 4 - 4 + 1 = 1.\n- Query = 5: The interval \\[3,6\\] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 6 - 3 + 1 = 4.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** intervals = \\[\\[2,3\\],\\[2,5\\],\\[1,8\\],\\[20,25\\]\\], queries = \\[2,19,5,22\\]\n**Output:** \\[2,-1,4,6\\]\n**Explanation:** The queries are processed as follows:\n- Query = 2: The interval \\[2,3\\] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 3 - 2 + 1 = 2.\n- Query = 19: None of the intervals contain 19. The answer is -1.\n- Query = 5: The interval \\[2,5\\] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 5 - 2 + 1 = 4.\n- Query = 22: The interval \\[20,25\\] is the smallest interval containing 22. The answer is 25 - 20 + 1 = 6.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= intervals.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= queries.length <= 105`\n*   `intervals[i].length == 2`\n*   `1 <= lefti <= righti <= 107`\n*   `1 <= queries[j] <= 107`",
