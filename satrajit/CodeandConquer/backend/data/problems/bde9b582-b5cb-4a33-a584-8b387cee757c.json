  "description": "You are given a positive integer array `grades` which represents the grades of students in a university. You would like to enter **all** these students into a competition in **ordered** non-empty groups, such that the ordering meets the following conditions:\n\n*   The sum of the grades of students in the `ith` group is **less than** the sum of the grades of students in the `(i + 1)th` group, for all groups (except the last).\n*   The total number of students in the `ith` group is **less than** the total number of students in the `(i + 1)th` group, for all groups (except the last).\n\nReturn _the **maximum** number of groups that can be formed_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** grades = \\[10,6,12,7,3,5\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** The following is a possible way to form 3 groups of students:\n- 1st group has the students with grades = \\[12\\]. Sum of grades: 12. Student count: 1\n- 2nd group has the students with grades = \\[6,7\\]. Sum of grades: 6 + 7 = 13. Student count: 2\n- 3rd group has the students with grades = \\[10,3,5\\]. Sum of grades: 10 + 3 + 5 = 18. Student count: 3\nIt can be shown that it is not possible to form more than 3 groups.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** grades = \\[8,8\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** We can only form 1 group, since forming 2 groups would lead to an equal number of students in both groups.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= grades.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= grades[i] <= 105`",
