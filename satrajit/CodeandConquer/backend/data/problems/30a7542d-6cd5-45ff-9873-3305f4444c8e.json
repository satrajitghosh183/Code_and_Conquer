  "description": "You are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and exactly `n - 1` `edges`. The **root** of the tree is the node `0`, and each node of the tree has **a label** which is a lower-case character given in the string `labels` (i.e. The node with the number `i` has the label `labels[i]`).\n\nThe `edges` array is given on the form `edges[i] = [ai, bi]`, which means there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree.\n\nReturn _an array of size `n`_ where `ans[i]` is the number of nodes in the subtree of the `ith` node which have the same label as node `i`.\n\nA subtree of a tree `T` is the tree consisting of a node in `T` and all of its descendant nodes.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 7, edges = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[0,2\\],\\[1,4\\],\\[1,5\\],\\[2,3\\],\\[2,6\\]\\], labels =  \"abaedcd \"\n**Output:** \\[2,1,1,1,1,1,1\\]\n**Explanation:** Node 0 has label 'a' and its sub-tree has node 2 with label 'a' as well, thus the answer is 2. Notice that any node is part of its sub-tree.\nNode 1 has a label 'b'. The sub-tree of node 1 contains nodes 1,4 and 5, as nodes 4 and 5 have different labels than node 1, the answer is just 1 (the node itself).\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 4, edges = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[0,3\\]\\], labels =  \"bbbb \"\n**Output:** \\[4,2,1,1\\]\n**Explanation:** The sub-tree of node 2 contains only node 2, so the answer is 1.\nThe sub-tree of node 3 contains only node 3, so the answer is 1.\nThe sub-tree of node 1 contains nodes 1 and 2, both have label 'b', thus the answer is 2.\nThe sub-tree of node 0 contains nodes 0, 1, 2 and 3, all with label 'b', thus the answer is 4.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** n = 5, edges = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[0,2\\],\\[1,3\\],\\[0,4\\]\\], labels =  \"aabab \"\n**Output:** \\[3,2,1,1,1\\]\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= n <= 105`\n*   `edges.length == n - 1`\n*   `edges[i].length == 2`\n*   `0 <= ai, bi < n`\n*   `ai != bi`\n*   `labels.length == n`\n*   `labels` is consisting of only of lowercase English letters.",
