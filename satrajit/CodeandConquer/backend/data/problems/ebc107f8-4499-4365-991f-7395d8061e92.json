  "slug": "number-of-ways-to-rearrange-sticks-with-k-sticks-visible",
  "description": "There are `n` uniquely-sized sticks whose lengths are integers from `1` to `n`. You want to arrange the sticks such that **exactly** `k` sticks are **visible** from the left. A stick is **visible** from the left if there are no **longer** sticks to the **left** of it.\n\n*   For example, if the sticks are arranged `[1,3,2,5,4]`, then the sticks with lengths `1`, `3`, and `5` are visible from the left.\n\nGiven `n` and `k`, return _the **number** of such arrangements_. Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 3, k = 2\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** \\[1,3,2\\], \\[2,3,1\\], and \\[2,1,3\\] are the only arrangements such that exactly 2 sticks are visible.\nThe visible sticks are underlined.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 5, k = 5\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** \\[1,2,3,4,5\\] is the only arrangement such that all 5 sticks are visible.\nThe visible sticks are underlined.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** n = 20, k = 11\n**Output:** 647427950\n**Explanation:** There are 647427950 (mod 109 \\+ 7) ways to rearrange the sticks such that exactly 11 sticks are visible.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= n <= 1000`\n*   `1 <= k <= n`",
