  "description": "There are `n` oranges in the kitchen and you decided to eat some of these oranges every day as follows:\n\n*   Eat one orange.\n*   If the number of remaining oranges `n` is divisible by `2` then you can eat `n / 2` oranges.\n*   If the number of remaining oranges `n` is divisible by `3` then you can eat `2 * (n / 3)` oranges.\n\nYou can only choose one of the actions per day.\n\nGiven the integer `n`, return _the minimum number of days to eat_ `n` _oranges_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 10\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** You have 10 oranges.\nDay 1: Eat 1 orange,  10 - 1 = 9.  \nDay 2: Eat 6 oranges, 9 - 2\\*(9/3) = 9 - 6 = 3. (Since 9 is divisible by 3)\nDay 3: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2\\*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1. \nDay 4: Eat the last orange  1 - 1  = 0.\nYou need at least 4 days to eat the 10 oranges.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 6\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** You have 6 oranges.\nDay 1: Eat 3 oranges, 6 - 6/2 = 6 - 3 = 3. (Since 6 is divisible by 2).\nDay 2: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2\\*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1. (Since 3 is divisible by 3)\nDay 3: Eat the last orange  1 - 1  = 0.\nYou need at least 3 days to eat the 6 oranges.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= n <= 2 * 109`",
