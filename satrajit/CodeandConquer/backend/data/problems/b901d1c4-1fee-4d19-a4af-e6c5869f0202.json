  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `mapping` which represents the mapping rule of a shuffled decimal system. `mapping[i] = j` means digit `i` should be mapped to digit `j` in this system.\n\nThe **mapped value** of an integer is the new integer obtained by replacing each occurrence of digit `i` in the integer with `mapping[i]` for all `0 <= i <= 9`.\n\nYou are also given another integer array `nums`. Return _the array_ `nums` _sorted in **non-decreasing** order based on the **mapped values** of its elements._\n\n**Notes:**\n\n*   Elements with the same mapped values should appear in the **same relative order** as in the input.\n*   The elements of `nums` should only be sorted based on their mapped values and **not be replaced** by them.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** mapping = \\[8,9,4,0,2,1,3,5,7,6\\], nums = \\[991,338,38\\]\n**Output:** \\[338,38,991\\]\n**Explanation:** \nMap the number 991 as follows:\n1. mapping\\[9\\] = 6, so all occurrences of the digit 9 will become 6.\n2. mapping\\[1\\] = 9, so all occurrences of the digit 1 will become 9.\nTherefore, the mapped value of 991 is 669.\n338 maps to 007, or 7 after removing the leading zeros.\n38 maps to 07, which is also 7 after removing leading zeros.\nSince 338 and 38 share the same mapped value, they should remain in the same relative order, so 338 comes before 38.\nThus, the sorted array is \\[338,38,991\\].\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** mapping = \\[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\], nums = \\[789,456,123\\]\n**Output:** \\[123,456,789\\]\n**Explanation:** 789 maps to 789, 456 maps to 456, and 123 maps to 123. Thus, the sorted array is \\[123,456,789\\].\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `mapping.length == 10`\n*   `0 <= mapping[i] <= 9`\n*   All the values of `mapping[i]` are **unique**.\n*   `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`\n*   `0 <= nums[i] < 109`",
