  "description": "You are playing a game of tag with your friends. In tag, people are divided into two teams: people who are \"it \", and people who are not \"it \". The people who are \"it \" want to catch as many people as possible who are not \"it \".\n\nYou are given a **0-indexed** integer array `team` containing only zeros (denoting people who are **not** \"it \") and ones (denoting people who are \"it \"), and an integer `dist`. A person who is \"it \" at index `i` can catch any **one** person whose index is in the range `[i - dist, i + dist]` (**inclusive**) and is **not** \"it \".\n\nReturn _the **maximum** number of people that the people who are \"it \" can catch_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** team = \\[0,1,0,1,0\\], dist = 3\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:**\nThe person who is  \"it \" at index 1 can catch people in the range \\[i-dist, i+dist\\] = \\[1-3, 1+3\\] = \\[-2, 4\\].\nThey can catch the person who is not  \"it \" at index 2.\nThe person who is  \"it \" at index 3 can catch people in the range \\[i-dist, i+dist\\] = \\[3-3, 3+3\\] = \\[0, 6\\].\nThey can catch the person who is not  \"it \" at index 0.\nThe person who is not  \"it \" at index 4 will not be caught because the people at indices 1 and 3 are already catching one person.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** team = \\[1\\], dist = 1\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:**\nThere are no people who are not  \"it \" to catch.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** team = \\[0\\], dist = 1\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:**\nThere are no people who are  \"it \" to catch people.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= team.length <= 105`\n*   `0 <= team[i] <= 1`\n*   `1 <= dist <= team.length`",
