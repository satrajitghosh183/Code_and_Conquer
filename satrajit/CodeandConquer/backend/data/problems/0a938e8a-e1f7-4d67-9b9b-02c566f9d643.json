  "slug": "maximum-twin-sum-of-a-linked-list",
  "description": "In a linked list of size `n`, where `n` is **even**, the `ith` node (**0-indexed**) of the linked list is known as the **twin** of the `(n-1-i)th` node, if `0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1`.\n\n*   For example, if `n = 4`, then node `0` is the twin of node `3`, and node `1` is the twin of node `2`. These are the only nodes with twins for `n = 4`.\n\nThe **twin sum** is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.\n\nGiven the `head` of a linked list with even length, return _the **maximum twin sum** of the linked list_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** head = \\[5,4,2,1\\]\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:**\nNodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. All have twin sum = 6.\nThere are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.\nThus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is 6. \n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** head = \\[4,2,2,3\\]\n**Output:** 7\n**Explanation:**\nThe nodes with twins present in this linked list are:\n- Node 0 is the twin of node 3 having a twin sum of 4 + 3 = 7.\n- Node 1 is the twin of node 2 having a twin sum of 2 + 2 = 4.\nThus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is max(7, 4) = 7. \n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** head = \\[1,100000\\]\n**Output:** 100001\n**Explanation:**\nThere is only one node with a twin in the linked list having twin sum of 1 + 100000 = 100001.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   The number of nodes in the list is an **even** integer in the range `[2, 105]`.\n*   `1 <= Node.val <= 105`",
