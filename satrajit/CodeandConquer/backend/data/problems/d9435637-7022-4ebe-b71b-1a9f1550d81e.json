  "description": "There is a **1-based** binary matrix where `0` represents land and `1` represents water. You are given integers `row` and `col` representing the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively.\n\nInitially on day `0`, the **entire** matrix is **land**. However, each day a new cell becomes flooded with **water**. You are given a **1-based** 2D array `cells`, where `cells[i] = [ri, ci]` represents that on the `ith` day, the cell on the `rith` row and `cith` column (**1-based** coordinates) will be covered with **water** (i.e., changed to `1`).\n\nYou want to find the **last** day that it is possible to walk from the **top** to the **bottom** by only walking on land cells. You can start from **any** cell in the top row and end at **any** cell in the bottom row. You can only travel in the **four** cardinal directions (left, right, up, and down).\n\nReturn _the **last** day where it is possible to walk from the **top** to the **bottom** by only walking on land cells_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** row = 2, col = 2, cells = \\[\\[1,1\\],\\[2,1\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[2,2\\]\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** The above image depicts how the matrix changes each day starting from day 0.\nThe last day where it is possible to cross from top to bottom is on day 2.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** row = 2, col = 2, cells = \\[\\[1,1\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[2,1\\],\\[2,2\\]\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** The above image depicts how the matrix changes each day starting from day 0.\nThe last day where it is possible to cross from top to bottom is on day 1.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** row = 3, col = 3, cells = \\[\\[1,2\\],\\[2,1\\],\\[3,3\\],\\[2,2\\],\\[1,1\\],\\[1,3\\],\\[2,3\\],\\[3,2\\],\\[3,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** The above image depicts how the matrix changes each day starting from day 0.\nThe last day where it is possible to cross from top to bottom is on day 3.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= row, col <= 2 * 104`\n*   `4 <= row * col <= 2 * 104`\n*   `cells.length == row * col`\n*   `1 <= ri <= row`\n*   `1 <= ci <= col`\n*   All the values of `cells` are **unique**.",
