  "description": "Given `n` points on a 1-D plane, where the `ith` point (from `0` to `n-1`) is at `x = i`, find the number of ways we can draw **exactly** `k` **non-overlapping** line segments such that each segment covers two or more points. The endpoints of each segment must have **integral coordinates**. The `k` line segments **do not** have to cover all `n` points, and they are **allowed** to share endpoints.\n\nReturn _the number of ways we can draw_ `k` _non-overlapping line segments__._ Since this number can be huge, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 4, k = 2\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** The two line segments are shown in red and blue.\nThe image above shows the 5 different ways {(0,2),(2,3)}, {(0,1),(1,3)}, {(0,1),(2,3)}, {(1,2),(2,3)}, {(0,1),(1,2)}.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 3, k = 1\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** The 3 ways are {(0,1)}, {(0,2)}, {(1,2)}.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** n = 30, k = 7\n**Output:** 796297179\n**Explanation:** The total number of possible ways to draw 7 line segments is 3796297200. Taking this number modulo 109 + 7 gives us 796297179.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= n <= 1000`\n*   `1 <= k <= n-1`",
