  "description": "You are given a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a **connected undirected graph** containing **exactly one** cycle. The nodes are numbered from `0` to `n - 1` (**inclusive**).\n\nYou are also given a 2D integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [node1i, node2i]` denotes that there is a **bidirectional** edge connecting `node1i` and `node2i` in the graph.\n\nThe distance between two nodes `a` and `b` is defined to be the **minimum** number of edges that are needed to go from `a` to `b`.\n\nReturn _an integer array `answer`_ _of size_ `n`_, where_ `answer[i]` _is the **minimum** distance between the_ `ith` _node and **any** node in the cycle._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 7, edges = \\[\\[1,2\\],\\[2,4\\],\\[4,3\\],\\[3,1\\],\\[0,1\\],\\[5,2\\],\\[6,5\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[1,0,0,0,0,1,2\\]\n**Explanation:**\nThe nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 form the cycle.\nThe distance from 0 to 1 is 1.\nThe distance from 1 to 1 is 0.\nThe distance from 2 to 2 is 0.\nThe distance from 3 to 3 is 0.\nThe distance from 4 to 4 is 0.\nThe distance from 5 to 2 is 1.\nThe distance from 6 to 2 is 2.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 9, edges = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[0,2\\],\\[2,6\\],\\[6,7\\],\\[6,8\\],\\[0,3\\],\\[3,4\\],\\[3,5\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[0,0,0,1,2,2,1,2,2\\]\n**Explanation:**\nThe nodes 0, 1, and 2 form the cycle.\nThe distance from 0 to 0 is 0.\nThe distance from 1 to 1 is 0.\nThe distance from 2 to 2 is 0.\nThe distance from 3 to 1 is 1.\nThe distance from 4 to 1 is 2.\nThe distance from 5 to 1 is 2.\nThe distance from 6 to 2 is 1.\nThe distance from 7 to 2 is 2.\nThe distance from 8 to 2 is 2.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `3 <= n <= 105`\n*   `edges.length == n`\n*   `edges[i].length == 2`\n*   `0 <= node1i, node2i <= n - 1`\n*   `node1i != node2i`\n*   The graph is connected.\n*   The graph has exactly one cycle.\n*   There is at most one edge between any pair of vertices.",
