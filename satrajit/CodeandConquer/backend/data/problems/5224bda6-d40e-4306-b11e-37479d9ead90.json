  "slug": "minimum-path-cost-in-a-grid",
  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` integer matrix `grid` consisting of **distinct** integers from `0` to `m * n - 1`. You can move in this matrix from a cell to any other cell in the **next** row. That is, if you are in cell `(x, y)` such that `x < m - 1`, you can move to any of the cells `(x + 1, 0)`, `(x + 1, 1)`, ..., `(x + 1, n - 1)`. **Note** that it is not possible to move from cells in the last row.\n\nEach possible move has a cost given by a **0-indexed** 2D array `moveCost` of size `(m * n) x n`, where `moveCost[i][j]` is the cost of moving from a cell with value `i` to a cell in column `j` of the next row. The cost of moving from cells in the last row of `grid` can be ignored.\n\nThe cost of a path in `grid` is the **sum** of all values of cells visited plus the **sum** of costs of all the moves made. Return _the **minimum** cost of a path that starts from any cell in the **first** row and ends at any cell in the **last** row._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[5,3\\],\\[4,0\\],\\[2,1\\]\\], moveCost = \\[\\[9,8\\],\\[1,5\\],\\[10,12\\],\\[18,6\\],\\[2,4\\],\\[14,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** 17\n**Explanation:** The path with the minimum possible cost is the path 5 -> 0 -> 1.\n- The sum of the values of cells visited is 5 + 0 + 1 = 6.\n- The cost of moving from 5 to 0 is 3.\n- The cost of moving from 0 to 1 is 8.\nSo the total cost of the path is 6 + 3 + 8 = 17.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[5,1,2\\],\\[4,0,3\\]\\], moveCost = \\[\\[12,10,15\\],\\[20,23,8\\],\\[21,7,1\\],\\[8,1,13\\],\\[9,10,25\\],\\[5,3,2\\]\\]\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:** The path with the minimum possible cost is the path 2 -> 3.\n- The sum of the values of cells visited is 2 + 3 = 5.\n- The cost of moving from 2 to 3 is 1.\nSo the total cost of this path is 5 + 1 = 6.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `m == grid.length`\n*   `n == grid[i].length`\n*   `2 <= m, n <= 50`\n*   `grid` consists of distinct integers from `0` to `m * n - 1`.\n*   `moveCost.length == m * n`\n*   `moveCost[i].length == n`\n*   `1 <= moveCost[i][j] <= 100`",
