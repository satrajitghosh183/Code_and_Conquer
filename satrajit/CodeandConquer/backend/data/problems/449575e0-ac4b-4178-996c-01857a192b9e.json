  "slug": "rearrange-spaces-between-words",
  "description": "You are given a string `text` of words that are placed among some number of spaces. Each word consists of one or more lowercase English letters and are separated by at least one space. It's guaranteed that `text` **contains at least one word**.\n\nRearrange the spaces so that there is an **equal** number of spaces between every pair of adjacent words and that number is **maximized**. If you cannot redistribute all the spaces equally, place the **extra spaces at the end**, meaning the returned string should be the same length as `text`.\n\nReturn _the string after rearranging the spaces_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** text =  \"  this   is  a sentence  \"\n**Output:**  \"this   is   a   sentence \"\n**Explanation:** There are a total of 9 spaces and 4 words. We can evenly divide the 9 spaces between the words: 9 / (4-1) = 3 spaces.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** text =  \" practice   makes   perfect \"\n**Output:**  \"practice   makes   perfect  \"\n**Explanation:** There are a total of 7 spaces and 3 words. 7 / (3-1) = 3 spaces plus 1 extra space. We place this extra space at the end of the string.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= text.length <= 100`\n*   `text` consists of lowercase English letters and `' '`.\n*   `text` contains at least one word.",
