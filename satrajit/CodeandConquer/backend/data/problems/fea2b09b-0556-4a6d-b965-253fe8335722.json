  "description": "You are given an array of integers `nums`. Perform the following steps:\n\n1.  Find **any** two **adjacent** numbers in `nums` that are **non-coprime**.\n2.  If no such numbers are found, **stop** the process.\n3.  Otherwise, delete the two numbers and **replace** them with their **LCM (Least Common Multiple)**.\n4.  **Repeat** this process as long as you keep finding two adjacent non-coprime numbers.\n\nReturn _the **final** modified array._ It can be shown that replacing adjacent non-coprime numbers in **any** arbitrary order will lead to the same result.\n\nThe test cases are generated such that the values in the final array are **less than or equal** to `108`.\n\nTwo values `x` and `y` are **non-coprime** if `GCD(x, y) > 1` where `GCD(x, y)` is the **Greatest Common Divisor** of `x` and `y`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[6,4,3,2,7,6,2\\]\n**Output:** \\[12,7,6\\]\n**Explanation:** \n- (6, 4) are non-coprime with LCM(6, 4) = 12. Now, nums = \\[**12**,3,2,7,6,2\\].\n- (12, 3) are non-coprime with LCM(12, 3) = 12. Now, nums = \\[**12**,2,7,6,2\\].\n- (12, 2) are non-coprime with LCM(12, 2) = 12. Now, nums = \\[**12**,7,6,2\\].\n- (6, 2) are non-coprime with LCM(6, 2) = 6. Now, nums = \\[12,7,**6**\\].\nThere are no more adjacent non-coprime numbers in nums.\nThus, the final modified array is \\[12,7,6\\].\nNote that there are other ways to obtain the same resultant array.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[2,2,1,1,3,3,3\\]\n**Output:** \\[2,1,1,3\\]\n**Explanation:** \n- (3, 3) are non-coprime with LCM(3, 3) = 3. Now, nums = \\[2,2,1,1,**3**,3\\].\n- (3, 3) are non-coprime with LCM(3, 3) = 3. Now, nums = \\[2,2,1,1,**3**\\].\n- (2, 2) are non-coprime with LCM(2, 2) = 2. Now, nums = \\[**2**,1,1,3\\].\nThere are no more adjacent non-coprime numbers in nums.\nThus, the final modified array is \\[2,1,1,3\\].\nNote that there are other ways to obtain the same resultant array.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 105`\n*   The test cases are generated such that the values in the final array are **less than or equal** to `108`.",
