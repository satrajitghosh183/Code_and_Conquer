  "slug": "last-moment-before-all-ants-fall-out-of-a-plank",
  "description": "We have a wooden plank of the length `n` **units**. Some ants are walking on the plank, each ant moves with a speed of **1 unit per second**. Some of the ants move to the **left**, the other move to the **right**.\n\nWhen two ants moving in two **different** directions meet at some point, they change their directions and continue moving again. Assume changing directions does not take any additional time.\n\nWhen an ant reaches **one end** of the plank at a time `t`, it falls out of the plank immediately.\n\nGiven an integer `n` and two integer arrays `left` and `right`, the positions of the ants moving to the left and the right, return _the moment when the last ant(s) fall out of the plank_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 4, left = \\[4,3\\], right = \\[0,1\\]\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** In the image above:\n-The ant at index 0 is named A and going to the right.\n-The ant at index 1 is named B and going to the right.\n-The ant at index 3 is named C and going to the left.\n-The ant at index 4 is named D and going to the left.\nThe last moment when an ant was on the plank is t = 4 seconds. After that, it falls immediately out of the plank. (i.e., We can say that at t = 4.0000000001, there are no ants on the plank).\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 7, left = \\[\\], right = \\[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\]\n**Output:** 7\n**Explanation:** All ants are going to the right, the ant at index 0 needs 7 seconds to fall.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** n = 7, left = \\[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\], right = \\[\\]\n**Output:** 7\n**Explanation:** All ants are going to the left, the ant at index 7 needs 7 seconds to fall.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= n <= 104`\n*   `0 <= left.length <= n + 1`\n*   `0 <= left[i] <= n`\n*   `0 <= right.length <= n + 1`\n*   `0 <= right[i] <= n`\n*   `1 <= left.length + right.length <= n + 1`\n*   All values of `left` and `right` are unique, and each value can appear **only in one** of the two arrays.",
