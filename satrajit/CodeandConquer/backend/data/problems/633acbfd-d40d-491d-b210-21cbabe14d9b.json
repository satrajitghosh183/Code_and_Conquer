  "description": "There are `n` seats and `n` students in a room. You are given an array `seats` of length `n`, where `seats[i]` is the position of the `ith` seat. You are also given the array `students` of length `n`, where `students[j]` is the position of the `jth` student.\n\nYou may perform the following move any number of times:\n\n*   Increase or decrease the position of the `ith` student by `1` (i.e., moving the `ith` student from position `x` to `x + 1` or `x - 1`)\n\nReturn _the **minimum number of moves** required to move each student to a seat_ _such that no two students are in the same seat._\n\nNote that there may be **multiple** seats or students in the **same** position at the beginning.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** seats = \\[3,1,5\\], students = \\[2,7,4\\]\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** The students are moved as follows:\n- The first student is moved from from position 2 to position 1 using 1 move.\n- The second student is moved from from position 7 to position 5 using 2 moves.\n- The third student is moved from from position 4 to position 3 using 1 move.\nIn total, 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 moves were used.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** seats = \\[4,1,5,9\\], students = \\[1,3,2,6\\]\n**Output:** 7\n**Explanation:** The students are moved as follows:\n- The first student is not moved.\n- The second student is moved from from position 3 to position 4 using 1 move.\n- The third student is moved from from position 2 to position 5 using 3 moves.\n- The fourth student is moved from from position 6 to position 9 using 3 moves.\nIn total, 0 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 7 moves were used.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** seats = \\[2,2,6,6\\], students = \\[1,3,2,6\\]\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** Note that there are two seats at position 2 and two seats at position 6.\nThe students are moved as follows:\n- The first student is moved from from position 1 to position 2 using 1 move.\n- The second student is moved from from position 3 to position 6 using 3 moves.\n- The third student is not moved.\n- The fourth student is not moved.\nIn total, 1 + 3 + 0 + 0 = 4 moves were used.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == seats.length == students.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 100`\n*   `1 <= seats[i], students[j] <= 100`",
