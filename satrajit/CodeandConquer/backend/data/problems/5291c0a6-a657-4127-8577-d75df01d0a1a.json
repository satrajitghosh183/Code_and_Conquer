  "description": "You are given a phone number as a string `number`. `number` consists of digits, spaces `' '`, and/or dashes `'-'`.\n\nYou would like to reformat the phone number in a certain manner. Firstly, **remove** all spaces and dashes. Then, **group** the digits from left to right into blocks of length 3 **until** there are 4 or fewer digits. The final digits are then grouped as follows:\n\n*   2 digits: A single block of length 2.\n*   3 digits: A single block of length 3.\n*   4 digits: Two blocks of length 2 each.\n\nThe blocks are then joined by dashes. Notice that the reformatting process should **never** produce any blocks of length 1 and produce **at most** two blocks of length 2.\n\nReturn _the phone number after formatting._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** number =  \"1-23-45 6 \"\n**Output:**  \"123-456 \"\n**Explanation:** The digits are  \"123456 \".\nStep 1: There are more than 4 digits, so group the next 3 digits. The 1st block is  \"123 \".\nStep 2: There are 3 digits remaining, so put them in a single block of length 3. The 2nd block is  \"456 \".\nJoining the blocks gives  \"123-456 \".\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** number =  \"123 4-567 \"\n**Output:**  \"123-45-67 \"\n**Explanation:** The digits are  \"1234567 \".\nStep 1: There are more than 4 digits, so group the next 3 digits. The 1st block is  \"123 \".\nStep 2: There are 4 digits left, so split them into two blocks of length 2. The blocks are  \"45 \" and  \"67 \".\nJoining the blocks gives  \"123-45-67 \".\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** number =  \"123 4-5678 \"\n**Output:**  \"123-456-78 \"\n**Explanation:** The digits are  \"12345678 \".\nStep 1: The 1st block is  \"123 \".\nStep 2: The 2nd block is  \"456 \".\nStep 3: There are 2 digits left, so put them in a single block of length 2. The 3rd block is  \"78 \".\nJoining the blocks gives  \"123-456-78 \".\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= number.length <= 100`\n*   `number` consists of digits and the characters `'-'` and `' '`.\n*   There are at least **two** digits in `number`.",
