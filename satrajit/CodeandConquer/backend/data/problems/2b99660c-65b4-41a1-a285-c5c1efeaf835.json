  "description": "We will use a file-sharing system to share a very large file which consists of `m` small **chunks** with IDs from `1` to `m`.\n\nWhen users join the system, the system should assign **a unique** ID to them. The unique ID should be used **once** for each user, but when a user leaves the system, the ID can be **reused** again.\n\nUsers can request a certain chunk of the file, the system should return a list of IDs of all the users who own this chunk. If the user receives a non-empty list of IDs, they receive the requested chunk successfully.\n\n  \nImplement the `FileSharing` class:\n\n*   `FileSharing(int m)` Initializes the object with a file of `m` chunks.\n*   `int join(int[] ownedChunks)`: A new user joined the system owning some chunks of the file, the system should assign an id to the user which is the **smallest positive integer** not taken by any other user. Return the assigned id.\n*   `void leave(int userID)`: The user with `userID` will leave the system, you cannot take file chunks from them anymore.\n*   `int[] request(int userID, int chunkID)`: The user `userID` requested the file chunk with `chunkID`. Return a list of the IDs of all users that own this chunk sorted in ascending order.\n\n**Example:**\n\n**Input:**\n\\[ \"FileSharing \", \"join \", \"join \", \"join \", \"request \", \"request \", \"leave \", \"request \", \"leave \", \"join \"\\]\n\\[\\[4\\],\\[\\[1,2\\]\\],\\[\\[2,3\\]\\],\\[\\[4\\]\\],\\[1,3\\],\\[2,2\\],\\[1\\],\\[2,1\\],\\[2\\],\\[\\[\\]\\]\\]\n**Output:**\n\\[null,1,2,3,\\[2\\],\\[1,2\\],null,\\[\\],null,1\\]\n**Explanation:**\nFileSharing fileSharing = new FileSharing(4); // We use the system to share a file of 4 chunks.\n\nfileSharing.join(\\[1, 2\\]);    // A user who has chunks \\[1,2\\] joined the system, assign id = 1 to them and return 1.\n\nfileSharing.join(\\[2, 3\\]);    // A user who has chunks \\[2,3\\] joined the system, assign id = 2 to them and return 2.\n\nfileSharing.join(\\[4\\]);       // A user who has chunk \\[4\\] joined the system, assign id = 3 to them and return 3.\n\nfileSharing.request(1, 3);   // The user with id = 1 requested the third file chunk, as only the user with id = 2 has the file, return \\[2\\] . Notice that user 1 now has chunks \\[1,2,3\\].\n\nfileSharing.request(2, 2);   // The user with id = 2 requested the second file chunk, users with ids \\[1,2\\] have this chunk, thus we return \\[1,2\\].\n\nfileSharing.leave(1);        // The user with id = 1 left the system, all the file chunks with them are no longer available for other users.\n\nfileSharing.request(2, 1);   // The user with id = 2 requested the first file chunk, no one in the system has this chunk, we return empty list \\[\\].\n\nfileSharing.leave(2);        // The user with id = 2 left the system.\n\nfileSharing.join(\\[\\]);        // A user who doesn't have any chunks joined the system, assign id = 1 to them and return 1. Notice that ids 1 and 2 are free and we can reuse them.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= m <= 105`\n*   `0 <= ownedChunks.length <= min(100, m)`\n*   `1 <= ownedChunks[i] <= m`\n*   Values of `ownedChunks` are unique.\n*   `1 <= chunkID <= m`\n*   `userID` is guaranteed to be a user in the system if you **assign** the IDs **correctly**.\n*   At most `104` calls will be made to `join`, `leave` and `request`.\n*   Each call to `leave` will have a matching call for `join`.\n\n**Follow-up:**\n\n*   What happens if the system identifies the user by their IP address instead of their unique ID and users disconnect and connect from the system with the same IP?\n*   If the users in the system join and leave the system frequently without requesting any chunks, will your solution still be efficient?\n*   If all users join the system one time, request all files, and then leave, will your solution still be efficient?\n*   If the system will be used to share `n` files where the `ith` file consists of `m[i]`, what are the changes you have to make?",
