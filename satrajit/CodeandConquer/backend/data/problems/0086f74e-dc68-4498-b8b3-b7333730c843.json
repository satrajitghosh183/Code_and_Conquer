  "description": "You have `k` bags. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `weights` where `weights[i]` is the weight of the `ith` marble. You are also given the integer `k.`\n\nDivide the marbles into the `k` bags according to the following rules:\n\n*   No bag is empty.\n*   If the `ith` marble and `jth` marble are in a bag, then all marbles with an index between the `ith` and `jth` indices should also be in that same bag.\n*   If a bag consists of all the marbles with an index from `i` to `j` inclusively, then the cost of the bag is `weights[i] + weights[j]`.\n\nThe **score** after distributing the marbles is the sum of the costs of all the `k` bags.\n\nReturn _the **difference** between the **maximum** and **minimum** scores among marble distributions_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** weights = \\[1,3,5,1\\], k = 2\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** \nThe distribution \\[1\\],\\[3,5,1\\] results in the minimal score of (1+1) + (3+1) = 6. \nThe distribution \\[1,3\\],\\[5,1\\], results in the maximal score of (1+3) + (5+1) = 10. \nThus, we return their difference 10 - 6 = 4.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** weights = \\[1, 3\\], k = 2\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** The only distribution possible is \\[1\\],\\[3\\]. \nSince both the maximal and minimal score are the same, we return 0.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= k <= weights.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= weights[i] <= 109`",
