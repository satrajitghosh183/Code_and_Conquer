  "description": "You are given an array of `events` where `events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi, valuei]`. The `ith` event starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of `valuei`. You are also given an integer `k` which represents the maximum number of events you can attend.\n\nYou can only attend one event at a time. If you choose to attend an event, you must attend the **entire** event. Note that the end day is **inclusive**: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends on the same day.\n\nReturn _the **maximum sum** of values that you can receive by attending events._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** events = \\[\\[1,2,4\\],\\[3,4,3\\],\\[2,3,1\\]\\], k = 2\n**Output:** 7\n**Explanation:** Choose the green events, 0 and 1 (0-indexed) for a total value of 4 + 3 = 7.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** events = \\[\\[1,2,4\\],\\[3,4,3\\],\\[2,3,10\\]\\], k = 2\n**Output:** 10\n**Explanation:** Choose event 2 for a total value of 10.\nNotice that you cannot attend any other event as they overlap, and that you do **not** have to attend k events.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** events = \\[\\[1,1,1\\],\\[2,2,2\\],\\[3,3,3\\],\\[4,4,4\\]\\], k = 3\n**Output:** 9\n**Explanation:** Although the events do not overlap, you can only attend 3 events. Pick the highest valued three.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= k <= events.length`\n*   `1 <= k * events.length <= 106`\n*   `1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 109`\n*   `1 <= valuei <= 106`",
