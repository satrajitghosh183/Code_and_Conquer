  "description": "You would like to make dessert and are preparing to buy the ingredients. You have `n` ice cream base flavors and `m` types of toppings to choose from. You must follow these rules when making your dessert:\n\n*   There must be **exactly one** ice cream base.\n*   You can add **one or more** types of topping or have no toppings at all.\n*   There are **at most two** of **each type** of topping.\n\nYou are given three inputs:\n\n*   `baseCosts`, an integer array of length `n`, where each `baseCosts[i]` represents the price of the `ith` ice cream base flavor.\n*   `toppingCosts`, an integer array of length `m`, where each `toppingCosts[i]` is the price of **one** of the `ith` topping.\n*   `target`, an integer representing your target price for dessert.\n\nYou want to make a dessert with a total cost as close to `target` as possible.\n\nReturn _the closest possible cost of the dessert to_ `target`. If there are multiple, return _the **lower** one._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** baseCosts = \\[1,7\\], toppingCosts = \\[3,4\\], target = 10\n**Output:** 10\n**Explanation:** Consider the following combination (all 0-indexed):\n- Choose base 1: cost 7\n- Take 1 of topping 0: cost 1 x 3 = 3\n- Take 0 of topping 1: cost 0 x 4 = 0\nTotal: 7 + 3 + 0 = 10.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** baseCosts = \\[2,3\\], toppingCosts = \\[4,5,100\\], target = 18\n**Output:** 17\n**Explanation:** Consider the following combination (all 0-indexed):\n- Choose base 1: cost 3\n- Take 1 of topping 0: cost 1 x 4 = 4\n- Take 2 of topping 1: cost 2 x 5 = 10\n- Take 0 of topping 2: cost 0 x 100 = 0\nTotal: 3 + 4 + 10 + 0 = 17. You cannot make a dessert with a total cost of 18.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** baseCosts = \\[3,10\\], toppingCosts = \\[2,5\\], target = 9\n**Output:** 8\n**Explanation:** It is possible to make desserts with cost 8 and 10. Return 8 as it is the lower cost.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == baseCosts.length`\n*   `m == toppingCosts.length`\n*   `1 <= n, m <= 10`\n*   `1 <= baseCosts[i], toppingCosts[i] <= 104`\n*   `1 <= target <= 104`",
