  "slug": "minimum-time-for-k-virus-variants-to-spread",
  "description": "There are `n` **unique** virus variants in an infinite 2D grid. You are given a 2D array `points`, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a virus originating at `(xi, yi)` on day `0`. Note that it is possible for **multiple** virus variants to originate at the **same** point.\n\nEvery day, each cell infected with a virus variant will spread the virus to **all** neighboring points in the **four** cardinal directions (i.e. up, down, left, and right). If a cell has multiple variants, all the variants will spread without interfering with each other.\n\nGiven an integer `k`, return _the **minimum integer** number of days for **any** point to contain **at least**_ `k` _of the unique virus variants_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** points = \\[\\[1,1\\],\\[6,1\\]\\], k = 2\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** On day 3, points (3,1) and (4,1) will contain both virus variants. Note that these are not the only points that will contain both virus variants.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** points = \\[\\[3,3\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[9,2\\]\\], k = 2\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** On day 2, points (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), and (3,2) will contain the first two viruses. Note that these are not the only points that will contain both virus variants.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** points = \\[\\[3,3\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[9,2\\]\\], k = 3\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** On day 4, the point (5,2) will contain all 3 viruses. Note that this is not the only point that will contain all 3 virus variants.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == points.length`\n*   `2 <= n <= 50`\n*   `points[i].length == 2`\n*   `1 <= xi, yi <= 100`\n*   `2 <= k <= n`",
