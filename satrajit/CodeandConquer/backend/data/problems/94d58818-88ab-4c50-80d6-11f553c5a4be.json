  "title": "Minimum Costs Using the Train Line",
  "slug": "minimum-costs-using-the-train-line",
  "description": "A train line going through a city has two routes, the regular route and the express route. Both routes go through the **same** `n + 1` stops labeled from `0` to `n`. Initially, you start on the regular route at stop `0`.\n\nYou are given two **1-indexed** integer arrays `regular` and `express`, both of length `n`. `regular[i]` describes the cost it takes to go from stop `i - 1` to stop `i` using the regular route, and `express[i]` describes the cost it takes to go from stop `i - 1` to stop `i` using the express route.\n\nYou are also given an integer `expressCost` which represents the cost to transfer from the regular route to the express route.\n\nNote that:\n\n*   There is no cost to transfer from the express route back to the regular route.\n*   You pay `expressCost` **every** time you transfer from the regular route to the express route.\n*   There is no extra cost to stay on the express route.\n\nReturn _a **1-indexed** array_ `costs` _of length_ `n`_, where_ `costs[i]` _is the **minimum** cost to reach stop_ `i` _from stop_ `0`.\n\nNote that a stop can be counted as **reached** from either route.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** regular = \\[1,6,9,5\\], express = \\[5,2,3,10\\], expressCost = 8\n**Output:** \\[1,7,14,19\\]\n**Explanation:** The diagram above shows how to reach stop 4 from stop 0 with minimum cost.\n- Take the regular route from stop 0 to stop 1, costing 1.\n- Take the express route from stop 1 to stop 2, costing 8 + 2 = 10.\n- Take the express route from stop 2 to stop 3, costing 3.\n- Take the regular route from stop 3 to stop 4, costing 5.\nThe total cost is 1 + 10 + 3 + 5 = 19.\nNote that a different route could be taken to reach the other stops with minimum cost.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** regular = \\[11,5,13\\], express = \\[7,10,6\\], expressCost = 3\n**Output:** \\[10,15,24\\]\n**Explanation:** The diagram above shows how to reach stop 3 from stop 0 with minimum cost.\n- Take the express route from stop 0 to stop 1, costing 3 + 7 = 10.\n- Take the regular route from stop 1 to stop 2, costing 5.\n- Take the express route from stop 2 to stop 3, costing 3 + 6 = 9.\nThe total cost is 10 + 5 + 9 = 24.\nNote that the expressCost is paid again to transfer back to the express route.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == regular.length == express.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 105`\n*   `1 <= regular[i], express[i], expressCost <= 105`",
