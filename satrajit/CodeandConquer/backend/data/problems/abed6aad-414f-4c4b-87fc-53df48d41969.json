  "description": "Alice has `n` balloons arranged on a rope. You are given a **0-indexed** string `colors` where `colors[i]` is the color of the `ith` balloon.\n\nAlice wants the rope to be **colorful**. She does not want **two consecutive balloons** to be of the same color, so she asks Bob for help. Bob can remove some balloons from the rope to make it **colorful**. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `neededTime` where `neededTime[i]` is the time (in seconds) that Bob needs to remove the `ith` balloon from the rope.\n\nReturn _the **minimum time** Bob needs to make the rope **colorful**_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** colors =  \"abaac \", neededTime = \\[1,2,3,4,5\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** In the above image, 'a' is blue, 'b' is red, and 'c' is green.\nBob can remove the blue balloon at index 2. This takes 3 seconds.\nThere are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 3.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** colors =  \"abc \", neededTime = \\[1,2,3\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** The rope is already colorful. Bob does not need to remove any balloons from the rope.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** colors =  \"aabaa \", neededTime = \\[1,2,3,4,1\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** Bob will remove the ballons at indices 0 and 4. Each ballon takes 1 second to remove.\nThere are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == colors.length == neededTime.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 105`\n*   `1 <= neededTime[i] <= 104`\n*   `colors` contains only lowercase English letters.",
