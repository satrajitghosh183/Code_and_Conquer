  "description": "You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.\n\nFind the longest subsequence of `nums` that meets the following requirements:\n\n*   The subsequence is **strictly increasing** and\n*   The difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence is **at most** `k`.\n\nReturn _the length of the **longest** **subsequence** that meets the requirements._\n\nA **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[4,2,1,4,3,4,5,8,15\\], k = 3\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:**\nThe longest subsequence that meets the requirements is \\[1,3,4,5,8\\].\nThe subsequence has a length of 5, so we return 5.\nNote that the subsequence \\[1,3,4,5,8,15\\] does not meet the requirements because 15 - 8 = 7 is larger than 3.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[7,4,5,1,8,12,4,7\\], k = 5\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:**\nThe longest subsequence that meets the requirements is \\[4,5,8,12\\].\nThe subsequence has a length of 4, so we return 4.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[1,5\\], k = 1\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:**\nThe longest subsequence that meets the requirements is \\[1\\].\nThe subsequence has a length of 1, so we return 1.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= nums[i], k <= 105`",
