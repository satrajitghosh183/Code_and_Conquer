  "description": "There is an `8 x 8` chessboard containing `n` pieces (rooks, queens, or bishops). You are given a string array `pieces` of length `n`, where `pieces[i]` describes the type (rook, queen, or bishop) of the `ith` piece. In addition, you are given a 2D integer array `positions` also of length `n`, where `positions[i] = [ri, ci]` indicates that the `ith` piece is currently at the **1-based** coordinate `(ri, ci)` on the chessboard.\n\nWhen making a **move** for a piece, you choose a **destination** square that the piece will travel toward and stop on.\n\n*   A rook can only travel **horizontally or vertically** from `(r, c)` to the direction of `(r+1, c)`, `(r-1, c)`, `(r, c+1)`, or `(r, c-1)`.\n*   A queen can only travel **horizontally, vertically, or diagonally** from `(r, c)` to the direction of `(r+1, c)`, `(r-1, c)`, `(r, c+1)`, `(r, c-1)`, `(r+1, c+1)`, `(r+1, c-1)`, `(r-1, c+1)`, `(r-1, c-1)`.\n*   A bishop can only travel **diagonally** from `(r, c)` to the direction of `(r+1, c+1)`, `(r+1, c-1)`, `(r-1, c+1)`, `(r-1, c-1)`.\n\nYou must make a **move** for every piece on the board simultaneously. A **move combination** consists of all the **moves** performed on all the given pieces. Every second, each piece will instantaneously travel **one square** towards their destination if they are not already at it. All pieces start traveling at the `0th` second. A move combination is **invalid** if, at a given time, **two or more** pieces occupy the same square.\n\nReturn _the number of **valid** move combinations_​​​​​.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n*   **No two pieces** will start in the **same** square.\n*   You may choose the square a piece is already on as its **destination**.\n*   If two pieces are **directly adjacent** to each other, it is valid for them to **move past each other** and swap positions in one second.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** pieces = \\[ \"rook \"\\], positions = \\[\\[1,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** 15\n**Explanation:** The image above shows the possible squares the piece can move to.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** pieces = \\[ \"queen \"\\], positions = \\[\\[1,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** 22\n**Explanation:** The image above shows the possible squares the piece can move to.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** pieces = \\[ \"bishop \"\\], positions = \\[\\[4,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** 12\n**Explanation:** The image above shows the possible squares the piece can move to.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == pieces.length`\n*   `n == positions.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 4`\n*   `pieces` only contains the strings `\"rook \"`, `\"queen \"`, and `\"bishop \"`.\n*   There will be at most one queen on the chessboard.\n*   `1 <= xi, yi <= 8`\n*   Each `positions[i]` is distinct.",
