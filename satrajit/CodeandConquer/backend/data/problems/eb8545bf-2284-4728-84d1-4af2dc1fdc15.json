  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`.\n\n**Swaps** of **adjacent** elements are able to be performed on `nums`.\n\nA **valid** array meets the following conditions:\n\n*   The largest element (any of the largest elements if there are multiple) is at the rightmost position in the array.\n*   The smallest element (any of the smallest elements if there are multiple) is at the leftmost position in the array.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** swaps required to make_ `nums` _a valid array_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[3,4,5,5,3,1\\]\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:** Perform the following swaps:\n- Swap 1: Swap the 3rd and 4th elements, nums is then \\[3,4,5,**3**,**5**,1\\].\n- Swap 2: Swap the 4th and 5th elements, nums is then \\[3,4,5,3,**1**,**5**\\].\n- Swap 3: Swap the 3rd and 4th elements, nums is then \\[3,4,5,**1**,**3**,5\\].\n- Swap 4: Swap the 2nd and 3rd elements, nums is then \\[3,4,**1**,**5**,3,5\\].\n- Swap 5: Swap the 1st and 2nd elements, nums is then \\[3,**1**,**4**,5,3,5\\].\n- Swap 6: Swap the 0th and 1st elements, nums is then \\[**1**,**3**,4,5,3,5\\].\nIt can be shown that 6 swaps is the minimum swaps required to make a valid array.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[9\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** The array is already valid, so we return 0.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 105`",
