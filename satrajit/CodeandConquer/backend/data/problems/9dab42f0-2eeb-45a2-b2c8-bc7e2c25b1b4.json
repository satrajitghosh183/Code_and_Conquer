  "description": "You are **building** a string `s` of length `n` **one** character at a time, **prepending** each new character to the **front** of the string. The strings are labeled from `1` to `n`, where the string with length `i` is labeled `si`.\n\n*   For example, for `s = \"abaca \"`, `s1 == \"a \"`, `s2 == \"ca \"`, `s3 == \"aca \"`, etc.\n\nThe **score** of `si` is the length of the **longest common prefix** between `si` and `sn` (Note that `s == sn`).\n\nGiven the final string `s`, return _the **sum** of the **score** of every_ `si`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"babab \"\n**Output:** 9\n**Explanation:**\nFor s1 ==  \"b \", the longest common prefix is  \"b \" which has a score of 1.\nFor s2 ==  \"ab \", there is no common prefix so the score is 0.\nFor s3 ==  \"bab \", the longest common prefix is  \"bab \" which has a score of 3.\nFor s4 ==  \"abab \", there is no common prefix so the score is 0.\nFor s5 ==  \"babab \", the longest common prefix is  \"babab \" which has a score of 5.\nThe sum of the scores is 1 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 5 = 9, so we return 9.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"azbazbzaz \"\n**Output:** 14\n**Explanation:** \nFor s2 ==  \"az \", the longest common prefix is  \"az \" which has a score of 2.\nFor s6 ==  \"azbzaz \", the longest common prefix is  \"azb \" which has a score of 3.\nFor s9 ==  \"azbazbzaz \", the longest common prefix is  \"azbazbzaz \" which has a score of 9.\nFor all other si, the score is 0.\nThe sum of the scores is 2 + 3 + 9 = 14, so we return 14.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= s.length <= 105`\n*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters.",
