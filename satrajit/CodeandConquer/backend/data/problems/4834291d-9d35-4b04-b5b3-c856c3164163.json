  "description": "You are given a 2D integer array `stockPrices` where `stockPrices[i] = [dayi, pricei]` indicates the price of the stock on day `dayi` is `pricei`. A **line chart** is created from the array by plotting the points on an XY plane with the X-axis representing the day and the Y-axis representing the price and connecting adjacent points. One such example is shown below:\n\nReturn _the **minimum number of lines** needed to represent the line chart_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** stockPrices = \\[\\[1,7\\],\\[2,6\\],\\[3,5\\],\\[4,4\\],\\[5,4\\],\\[6,3\\],\\[7,2\\],\\[8,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:**\nThe diagram above represents the input, with the X-axis representing the day and Y-axis representing the price.\nThe following 3 lines can be drawn to represent the line chart:\n- Line 1 (in red) from (1,7) to (4,4) passing through (1,7), (2,6), (3,5), and (4,4).\n- Line 2 (in blue) from (4,4) to (5,4).\n- Line 3 (in green) from (5,4) to (8,1) passing through (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), and (8,1).\nIt can be shown that it is not possible to represent the line chart using less than 3 lines.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** stockPrices = \\[\\[3,4\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[7,8\\],\\[2,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:**\nAs shown in the diagram above, the line chart can be represented with a single line.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= stockPrices.length <= 105`\n*   `stockPrices[i].length == 2`\n*   `1 <= dayi, pricei <= 109`\n*   All `dayi` are **distinct**.",
