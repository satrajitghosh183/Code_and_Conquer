  "description": "You wrote down many **positive** integers in a string called `num`. However, you realized that you forgot to add commas to seperate the different numbers. You remember that the list of integers was **non-decreasing** and that **no** integer had leading zeros.\n\nReturn _the **number of possible lists of integers** that you could have written down to get the string_ `num`. Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** num =  \"327 \"\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** You could have written down the numbers:\n3, 27\n327\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** num =  \"094 \"\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** No numbers can have leading zeros and all numbers must be positive.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** num =  \"0 \"\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** No numbers can have leading zeros and all numbers must be positive.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= num.length <= 3500`\n*   `num` consists of digits `'0'` through `'9'`.",
