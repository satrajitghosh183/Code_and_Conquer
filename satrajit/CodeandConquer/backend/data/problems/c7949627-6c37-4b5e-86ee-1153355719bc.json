  "description": "There is a survey that consists of `n` questions where each question's answer is either `0` (no) or `1` (yes).\n\nThe survey was given to `m` students numbered from `0` to `m - 1` and `m` mentors numbered from `0` to `m - 1`. The answers of the students are represented by a 2D integer array `students` where `students[i]` is an integer array that contains the answers of the `ith` student (**0-indexed**). The answers of the mentors are represented by a 2D integer array `mentors` where `mentors[j]` is an integer array that contains the answers of the `jth` mentor (**0-indexed**).\n\nEach student will be assigned to **one** mentor, and each mentor will have **one** student assigned to them. The **compatibility score** of a student-mentor pair is the number of answers that are the same for both the student and the mentor.\n\n*   For example, if the student's answers were `[1, 0, 1]` and the mentor's answers were `[0, 0, 1]`, then their compatibility score is 2 because only the second and the third answers are the same.\n\nYou are tasked with finding the optimal student-mentor pairings to **maximize** the **sum of the compatibility scores**.\n\nGiven `students` and `mentors`, return _the **maximum compatibility score sum** that can be achieved._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** students = \\[\\[1,1,0\\],\\[1,0,1\\],\\[0,0,1\\]\\], mentors = \\[\\[1,0,0\\],\\[0,0,1\\],\\[1,1,0\\]\\]\n**Output:** 8\n**Explanation:** We assign students to mentors in the following way:\n- student 0 to mentor 2 with a compatibility score of 3.\n- student 1 to mentor 0 with a compatibility score of 2.\n- student 2 to mentor 1 with a compatibility score of 3.\nThe compatibility score sum is 3 + 2 + 3 = 8.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** students = \\[\\[0,0\\],\\[0,0\\],\\[0,0\\]\\], mentors = \\[\\[1,1\\],\\[1,1\\],\\[1,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** The compatibility score of any student-mentor pair is 0.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `m == students.length == mentors.length`\n*   `n == students[i].length == mentors[j].length`\n*   `1 <= m, n <= 8`\n*   `students[i][k]` is either `0` or `1`.\n*   `mentors[j][k]` is either `0` or `1`.",
