  "description": "You are playing a game that contains multiple characters, and each of the characters has **two** main properties: **attack** and **defense**. You are given a 2D integer array `properties` where `properties[i] = [attacki, defensei]` represents the properties of the `ith` character in the game.\n\nA character is said to be **weak** if any other character has **both** attack and defense levels **strictly greater** than this character's attack and defense levels. More formally, a character `i` is said to be **weak** if there exists another character `j` where `attackj > attacki` and `defensej > defensei`.\n\nReturn _the number of **weak** characters_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** properties = \\[\\[5,5\\],\\[6,3\\],\\[3,6\\]\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** No character has strictly greater attack and defense than the other.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** properties = \\[\\[2,2\\],\\[3,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** The first character is weak because the second character has a strictly greater attack and defense.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** properties = \\[\\[1,5\\],\\[10,4\\],\\[4,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** The third character is weak because the second character has a strictly greater attack and defense.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= properties.length <= 105`\n*   `properties[i].length == 2`\n*   `1 <= attacki, defensei <= 105`",
