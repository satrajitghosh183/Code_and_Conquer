  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `costs` where `costs[i]` is the cost of hiring the `ith` worker.\n\nYou are also given two integers `k` and `candidates`. We want to hire exactly `k` workers according to the following rules:\n\n*   You will run `k` sessions and hire exactly one worker in each session.\n*   In each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either the first `candidates` workers or the last `candidates` workers. Break the tie by the smallest index.\n    *   For example, if `costs = [3,2,7,7,1,2]` and `candidates = 2`, then in the first hiring session, we will choose the `4th` worker because they have the lowest cost `[3,2,7,7,**1**,2]`.\n    *   In the second hiring session, we will choose `1st` worker because they have the same lowest cost as `4th` worker but they have the smallest index `[3,**2**,7,7,2]`. Please note that the indexing may be changed in the process.\n*   If there are fewer than candidates workers remaining, choose the worker with the lowest cost among them. Break the tie by the smallest index.\n*   A worker can only be chosen once.\n\nReturn _the total cost to hire exactly_ `k` _workers._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** costs = \\[17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8\\], k = 3, candidates = 4\n**Output:** 11\n**Explanation:** We hire 3 workers in total. The total cost is initially 0.\n- In the first hiring round we choose the worker from \\[17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8\\]. The lowest cost is 2, and we break the tie by the smallest index, which is 3. The total cost = 0 + 2 = 2.\n- In the second hiring round we choose the worker from \\[17,12,10,7,2,11,20,8\\]. The lowest cost is 2 (index 4). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4.\n- In the third hiring round we choose the worker from \\[17,12,10,7,11,20,8\\]. The lowest cost is 7 (index 3). The total cost = 4 + 7 = 11. Notice that the worker with index 3 was common in the first and last four workers.\nThe total hiring cost is 11.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** costs = \\[1,2,4,1\\], k = 3, candidates = 3\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** We hire 3 workers in total. The total cost is initially 0.\n- In the first hiring round we choose the worker from \\[1,2,4,1\\]. The lowest cost is 1, and we break the tie by the smallest index, which is 0. The total cost = 0 + 1 = 1. Notice that workers with index 1 and 2 are common in the first and last 3 workers.\n- In the second hiring round we choose the worker from \\[2,4,1\\]. The lowest cost is 1 (index 2). The total cost = 1 + 1 = 2.\n- In the third hiring round there are less than three candidates. We choose the worker from the remaining workers \\[2,4\\]. The lowest cost is 2 (index 0). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4.\nThe total hiring cost is 4.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= costs.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= costs[i] <= 105`\n*   `1 <= k, candidates <= costs.length`",
