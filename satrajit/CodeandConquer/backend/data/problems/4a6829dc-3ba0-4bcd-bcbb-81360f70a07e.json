  "description": "There is a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and exactly `n - 1` edges.\n\nYou are given a **0-indexed** integer array `vals` of length `n` where `vals[i]` denotes the value of the `ith` node. You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` denotes that there exists an **undirected** edge connecting nodes `ai` and `bi`.\n\nA **good path** is a simple path that satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1.  The starting node and the ending node have the **same** value.\n2.  All nodes between the starting node and the ending node have values **less than or equal to** the starting node (i.e. the starting node's value should be the maximum value along the path).\n\nReturn _the number of distinct good paths_.\n\nNote that a path and its reverse are counted as the **same** path. For example, `0 -> 1` is considered to be the same as `1 -> 0`. A single node is also considered as a valid path.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** vals = \\[1,3,2,1,3\\], edges = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[0,2\\],\\[2,3\\],\\[2,4\\]\\]\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:** There are 5 good paths consisting of a single node.\nThere is 1 additional good path: 1 -> 0 -> 2 -> 4.\n(The reverse path 4 -> 2 -> 0 -> 1 is treated as the same as 1 -> 0 -> 2 -> 4.)\nNote that 0 -> 2 -> 3 is not a good path because vals\\[2\\] > vals\\[0\\].\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** vals = \\[1,1,2,2,3\\], edges = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[2,3\\],\\[2,4\\]\\]\n**Output:** 7\n**Explanation:** There are 5 good paths consisting of a single node.\nThere are 2 additional good paths: 0 -> 1 and 2 -> 3.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** vals = \\[1\\], edges = \\[\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** The tree consists of only one node, so there is one good path.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == vals.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 3 * 104`\n*   `0 <= vals[i] <= 105`\n*   `edges.length == n - 1`\n*   `edges[i].length == 2`\n*   `0 <= ai, bi < n`\n*   `ai != bi`\n*   `edges` represents a valid tree.",
