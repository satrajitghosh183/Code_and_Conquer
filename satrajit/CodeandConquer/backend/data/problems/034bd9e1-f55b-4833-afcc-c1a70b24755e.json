  "description": "You are playing a solitaire game with **three piles** of stones of sizes `a`​​​​​​, `b`,​​​​​​ and `c`​​​​​​ respectively. Each turn you choose two **different non-empty** piles, take one stone from each, and add `1` point to your score. The game stops when there are **fewer than two non-empty** piles (meaning there are no more available moves).\n\nGiven three integers `a`​​​​​, `b`,​​​​​ and `c`​​​​​, return _the_ **_maximum_** _**score** you can get._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** a = 2, b = 4, c = 6\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:** The starting state is (2, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:\n- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 4, 5)\n- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 4, 4)\n- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)\n- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)\n- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)\n- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)\nThere are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 6 points.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** a = 4, b = 4, c = 6\n**Output:** 7\n**Explanation:** The starting state is (4, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:\n- Take from 1st and 2nd piles, state is now (3, 3, 6)\n- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (2, 3, 5)\n- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 3, 4)\n- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)\n- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)\n- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)\n- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)\nThere are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 7 points.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** a = 1, b = 8, c = 8\n**Output:** 8\n**Explanation:** One optimal set of moves is to take from the 2nd and 3rd piles for 8 turns until they are empty.\nAfter that, there are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= a, b, c <= 105`",
