  "slug": "collect-coins-in-a-tree",
  "description": "There exists an undirected and unrooted tree with `n` nodes indexed from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given an integer `n` and a 2D integer array edges of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree. You are also given an array `coins` of size `n` where `coins[i]` can be either `0` or `1`, where `1` indicates the presence of a coin in the vertex `i`.\n\nInitially, you choose to start at any vertex in the tree. Then, you can perform the following operations any number of times:\n\n*   Collect all the coins that are at a distance of at most `2` from the current vertex, or\n*   Move to any adjacent vertex in the tree.\n\nFind _the minimum number of edges you need to go through to collect all the coins and go back to the initial vertex_.\n\nNote that if you pass an edge several times, you need to count it into the answer several times.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** coins = \\[1,0,0,0,0,1\\], edges = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[2,3\\],\\[3,4\\],\\[4,5\\]\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** Start at vertex 2, collect the coin at vertex 0, move to vertex 3, collect the coin at vertex 5 then move back to vertex 2.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** coins = \\[0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1\\], edges = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[0,2\\],\\[1,3\\],\\[1,4\\],\\[2,5\\],\\[5,6\\],\\[5,7\\]\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** Start at vertex 0, collect the coins at vertices 4 and 3, move to vertex 2,  collect the coin at vertex 7, then move back to vertex 0.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == coins.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 3 * 104`\n*   `0 <= coins[i] <= 1`\n*   `edges.length == n - 1`\n*   `edges[i].length == 2`\n*   `0 <= ai, bi < n`\n*   `ai != bi`\n*   `edges` represents a valid tree.",
