  "slug": "process-tasks-using-servers",
  "description": "You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `servers` and `tasks` of lengths `n`​​​​​​ and `m`​​​​​​ respectively. `servers[i]` is the **weight** of the `i​​​​​​th`​​​​ server, and `tasks[j]` is the **time needed** to process the `j​​​​​​th`​​​​ task **in seconds**.\n\nTasks are assigned to the servers using a **task queue**. Initially, all servers are free, and the queue is **empty**.\n\nAt second `j`, the `jth` task is **inserted** into the queue (starting with the `0th` task being inserted at second `0`). As long as there are free servers and the queue is not empty, the task in the front of the queue will be assigned to a free server with the **smallest weight**, and in case of a tie, it is assigned to a free server with the **smallest index**.\n\nIf there are no free servers and the queue is not empty, we wait until a server becomes free and immediately assign the next task. If multiple servers become free at the same time, then multiple tasks from the queue will be assigned **in order of insertion** following the weight and index priorities above.\n\nA server that is assigned task `j` at second `t` will be free again at second `t + tasks[j]`.\n\nBuild an array `ans`​​​​ of length `m`, where `ans[j]` is the **index** of the server the `j​​​​​​th` task will be assigned to.\n\nReturn _the array_ `ans`​​​​.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** servers = \\[3,3,2\\], tasks = \\[1,2,3,2,1,2\\]\n**Output:** \\[2,2,0,2,1,2\\]\n**Explanation:** Events in chronological order go as follows:\n- At second 0, task 0 is added and processed using server 2 until second 1.\n- At second 1, server 2 becomes free. Task 1 is added and processed using server 2 until second 3.\n- At second 2, task 2 is added and processed using server 0 until second 5.\n- At second 3, server 2 becomes free. Task 3 is added and processed using server 2 until second 5.\n- At second 4, task 4 is added and processed using server 1 until second 5.\n- At second 5, all servers become free. Task 5 is added and processed using server 2 until second 7.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** servers = \\[5,1,4,3,2\\], tasks = \\[2,1,2,4,5,2,1\\]\n**Output:** \\[1,4,1,4,1,3,2\\]\n**Explanation:** Events in chronological order go as follows: \n- At second 0, task 0 is added and processed using server 1 until second 2.\n- At second 1, task 1 is added and processed using server 4 until second 2.\n- At second 2, servers 1 and 4 become free. Task 2 is added and processed using server 1 until second 4. \n- At second 3, task 3 is added and processed using server 4 until second 7.\n- At second 4, server 1 becomes free. Task 4 is added and processed using server 1 until second 9. \n- At second 5, task 5 is added and processed using server 3 until second 7.\n- At second 6, task 6 is added and processed using server 2 until second 7.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `servers.length == n`\n*   `tasks.length == m`\n*   `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 105`\n*   `1 <= servers[i], tasks[j] <= 2 * 105`",
