  "description": "Given an integer `n`, find a sequence that satisfies all of the following:\n\n*   The integer `1` occurs once in the sequence.\n*   Each integer between `2` and `n` occurs twice in the sequence.\n*   For every integer `i` between `2` and `n`, the **distance** between the two occurrences of `i` is exactly `i`.\n\nThe **distance** between two numbers on the sequence, `a[i]` and `a[j]`, is the absolute difference of their indices, `|j - i|`.\n\nReturn _the **lexicographically largest** sequence__. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, there is always a solution._\n\nA sequence `a` is lexicographically larger than a sequence `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, sequence `a` has a number greater than the corresponding number in `b`. For example, `[0,1,9,0]` is lexicographically larger than `[0,1,5,6]` because the first position they differ is at the third number, and `9` is greater than `5`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 3\n**Output:** \\[3,1,2,3,2\\]\n**Explanation:** \\[2,3,2,1,3\\] is also a valid sequence, but \\[3,1,2,3,2\\] is the lexicographically largest valid sequence.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 5\n**Output:** \\[5,3,1,4,3,5,2,4,2\\]\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= n <= 20`",
