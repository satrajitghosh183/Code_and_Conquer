  "description": "Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the number of nodes where the value of the node is equal to the **sum** of the values of its descendants_.\n\nA **descendant** of a node `x` is any node that is on the path from node `x` to some leaf node. The sum is considered to be `0` if the node has no descendants.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** root = \\[10,3,4,2,1\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:**\nFor the node with value 10: The sum of its descendants is 3+4+2+1 = 10.\nFor the node with value 3: The sum of its descendants is 2+1 = 3.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** root = \\[2,3,null,2,null\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:**\nNo node has a value that is equal to the sum of its descendants.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** root = \\[0\\]\n**Output:** 1\nFor the node with value 0: The sum of its descendants is 0 since it has no descendants.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 105]`.\n*   `0 <= Node.val <= 105`",
