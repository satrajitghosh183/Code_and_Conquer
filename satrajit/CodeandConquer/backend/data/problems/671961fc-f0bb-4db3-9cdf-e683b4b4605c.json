  "description": "Design a system that manages the reservation state of `n` seats that are numbered from `1` to `n`.\n\nImplement the `SeatManager` class:\n\n*   `SeatManager(int n)` Initializes a `SeatManager` object that will manage `n` seats numbered from `1` to `n`. All seats are initially available.\n*   `int reserve()` Fetches the **smallest-numbered** unreserved seat, reserves it, and returns its number.\n*   `void unreserve(int seatNumber)` Unreserves the seat with the given `seatNumber`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input**\n\\[ \"SeatManager \",  \"reserve \",  \"reserve \",  \"unreserve \",  \"reserve \",  \"reserve \",  \"reserve \",  \"reserve \",  \"unreserve \"\\]\n\\[\\[5\\], \\[\\], \\[\\], \\[2\\], \\[\\], \\[\\], \\[\\], \\[\\], \\[5\\]\\]\n**Output**\n\\[null, 1, 2, null, 2, 3, 4, 5, null\\]\n\n**Explanation**\nSeatManager seatManager = new SeatManager(5); // Initializes a SeatManager with 5 seats.\nseatManager.reserve();    // All seats are available, so return the lowest numbered seat, which is 1.\nseatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are \\[2,3,4,5\\], so return the lowest of them, which is 2.\nseatManager.unreserve(2); // Unreserve seat 2, so now the available seats are \\[2,3,4,5\\].\nseatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are \\[2,3,4,5\\], so return the lowest of them, which is 2.\nseatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are \\[3,4,5\\], so return the lowest of them, which is 3.\nseatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are \\[4,5\\], so return the lowest of them, which is 4.\nseatManager.reserve();    // The only available seat is seat 5, so return 5.\nseatManager.unreserve(5); // Unreserve seat 5, so now the available seats are \\[5\\].\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= n <= 105`\n*   `1 <= seatNumber <= n`\n*   For each call to `reserve`, it is guaranteed that there will be at least one unreserved seat.\n*   For each call to `unreserve`, it is guaranteed that `seatNumber` will be reserved.\n*   At most `105` calls **in total** will be made to `reserve` and `unreserve`.",
