  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` consisting of `3 * n` elements.\n\nYou are allowed to remove any **subsequence** of elements of size **exactly** `n` from `nums`. The remaining `2 * n` elements will be divided into two **equal** parts:\n\n*   The first `n` elements belonging to the first part and their sum is `sumfirst`.\n*   The next `n` elements belonging to the second part and their sum is `sumsecond`.\n\nThe **difference in sums** of the two parts is denoted as `sumfirst - sumsecond`.\n\n*   For example, if `sumfirst = 3` and `sumsecond = 2`, their difference is `1`.\n*   Similarly, if `sumfirst = 2` and `sumsecond = 3`, their difference is `-1`.\n\nReturn _the **minimum difference** possible between the sums of the two parts after the removal of_ `n` _elements_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[3,1,2\\]\n**Output:** -1\n**Explanation:** Here, nums has 3 elements, so n = 1. \nThus we have to remove 1 element from nums and divide the array into two equal parts.\n- If we remove nums\\[0\\] = 3, the array will be \\[1,2\\]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 1 - 2 = -1.\n- If we remove nums\\[1\\] = 1, the array will be \\[3,2\\]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 2 = 1.\n- If we remove nums\\[2\\] = 2, the array will be \\[3,1\\]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 1 = 2.\nThe minimum difference between sums of the two parts is min(-1,1,2) = -1. \n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[7,9,5,8,1,3\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** Here n = 2. So we must remove 2 elements and divide the remaining array into two parts containing two elements each.\nIf we remove nums\\[2\\] = 5 and nums\\[3\\] = 8, the resultant array will be \\[7,9,1,3\\]. The difference in sums will be (7+9) - (1+3) = 12.\nTo obtain the minimum difference, we should remove nums\\[1\\] = 9 and nums\\[4\\] = 1. The resultant array becomes \\[7,5,8,3\\]. The difference in sums of the two parts is (7+5) - (8+3) = 1.\nIt can be shown that it is not possible to obtain a difference smaller than 1.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `nums.length == 3 * n`\n*   `1 <= n <= 105`\n*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 105`",
