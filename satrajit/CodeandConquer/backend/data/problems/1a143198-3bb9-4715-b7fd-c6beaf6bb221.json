  "description": "You are given an integer array `jobs`, where `jobs[i]` is the amount of time it takes to complete the `ith` job.\n\nThere are `k` workers that you can assign jobs to. Each job should be assigned to **exactly** one worker. The **working time** of a worker is the sum of the time it takes to complete all jobs assigned to them. Your goal is to devise an optimal assignment such that the **maximum working time** of any worker is **minimized**.\n\n_Return the **minimum** possible **maximum working time** of any assignment._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** jobs = \\[3,2,3\\], k = 3\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** By assigning each person one job, the maximum time is 3.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** jobs = \\[1,2,4,7,8\\], k = 2\n**Output:** 11\n**Explanation:** Assign the jobs the following way:\nWorker 1: 1, 2, 8 (working time = 1 + 2 + 8 = 11)\nWorker 2: 4, 7 (working time = 4 + 7 = 11)\nThe maximum working time is 11.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= k <= jobs.length <= 12`\n*   `1 <= jobs[i] <= 107`",
