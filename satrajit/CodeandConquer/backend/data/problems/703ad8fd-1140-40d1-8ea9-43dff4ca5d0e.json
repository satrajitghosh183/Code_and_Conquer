  "description": "You are given a **tree** (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) **rooted** at node `0` consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The tree is represented by a **0-indexed** array `parent` of size `n`, where `parent[i]` is the parent of node `i`. Since node `0` is the root, `parent[0] == -1`.\n\nYou are also given a string `s` of length `n`, where `s[i]` is the character assigned to node `i`.\n\nReturn _the length of the **longest path** in the tree such that no pair of **adjacent** nodes on the path have the same character assigned to them._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** parent = \\[-1,0,0,1,1,2\\], s =  \"abacbe \"\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** The longest path where each two adjacent nodes have different characters in the tree is the path: 0 -> 1 -> 3. The length of this path is 3, so 3 is returned.\nIt can be proven that there is no longer path that satisfies the conditions. \n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** parent = \\[-1,0,0,0\\], s =  \"aabc \"\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** The longest path where each two adjacent nodes have different characters is the path: 2 -> 0 -> 3. The length of this path is 3, so 3 is returned.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == parent.length == s.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 105`\n*   `0 <= parent[i] <= n - 1` for all `i >= 1`\n*   `parent[0] == -1`\n*   `parent` represents a valid tree.\n*   `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.",
