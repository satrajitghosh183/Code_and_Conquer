  "description": "You are given two strings, `word1` and `word2`. You want to construct a string in the following manner:\n\n*   Choose some **non-empty** subsequence `subsequence1` from `word1`.\n*   Choose some **non-empty** subsequence `subsequence2` from `word2`.\n*   Concatenate the subsequences: `subsequence1 + subsequence2`, to make the string.\n\nReturn _the **length** of the longest **palindrome** that can be constructed in the described manner._ If no palindromes can be constructed, return `0`.\n\nA **subsequence** of a string `s` is a string that can be made by deleting some (possibly none) characters from `s` without changing the order of the remaining characters.\n\nA **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forward as well as backward.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** word1 =  \"cacb \", word2 =  \"cbba \"\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** Choose  \"ab \" from word1 and  \"cba \" from word2 to make  \"abcba \", which is a palindrome.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** word1 =  \"ab \", word2 =  \"ab \"\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** Choose  \"ab \" from word1 and  \"a \" from word2 to make  \"aba \", which is a palindrome.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** word1 =  \"aa \", word2 =  \"bb \"\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** You cannot construct a palindrome from the described method, so return 0.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 1000`\n*   `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.",
