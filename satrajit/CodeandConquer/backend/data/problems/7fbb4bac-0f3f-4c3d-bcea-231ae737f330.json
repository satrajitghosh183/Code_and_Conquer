  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` consisting of only lowercase English letters, where each letter in `s` appears **exactly** **twice**. You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array `distance` of length `26`.\n\nEach letter in the alphabet is numbered from `0` to `25` (i.e. `'a' -> 0`, `'b' -> 1`, `'c' -> 2`, ... , `'z' -> 25`).\n\nIn a **well-spaced** string, the number of letters between the two occurrences of the `ith` letter is `distance[i]`. If the `ith` letter does not appear in `s`, then `distance[i]` can be **ignored**.\n\nReturn `true` _if_ `s` _is a **well-spaced** string, otherwise return_ `false`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"abaccb \", distance = \\[1,3,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\\]\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:**\n- 'a' appears at indices 0 and 2 so it satisfies distance\\[0\\] = 1.\n- 'b' appears at indices 1 and 5 so it satisfies distance\\[1\\] = 3.\n- 'c' appears at indices 3 and 4 so it satisfies distance\\[2\\] = 0.\nNote that distance\\[3\\] = 5, but since 'd' does not appear in s, it can be ignored.\nReturn true because s is a well-spaced string.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"aa \", distance = \\[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\\]\n**Output:** false\n**Explanation:**\n- 'a' appears at indices 0 and 1 so there are zero letters between them.\nBecause distance\\[0\\] = 1, s is not a well-spaced string.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= s.length <= 52`\n*   `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.\n*   Each letter appears in `s` exactly twice.\n*   `distance.length == 26`\n*   `0 <= distance[i] <= 50`",
