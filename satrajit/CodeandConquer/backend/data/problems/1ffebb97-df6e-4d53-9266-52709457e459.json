  "description": "You are given an undirected graph. You are given an integer `n` which is the number of nodes in the graph and an array `edges`, where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between `ui` and `vi`.\n\nA **connected trio** is a set of **three** nodes where there is an edge between **every** pair of them.\n\nThe **degree of a connected trio** is the number of edges where one endpoint is in the trio, and the other is not.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** degree of a connected trio in the graph, or_ `-1` _if the graph has no connected trios._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 6, edges = \\[\\[1,2\\],\\[1,3\\],\\[3,2\\],\\[4,1\\],\\[5,2\\],\\[3,6\\]\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** There is exactly one trio, which is \\[1,2,3\\]. The edges that form its degree are bolded in the figure above.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 7, edges = \\[\\[1,3\\],\\[4,1\\],\\[4,3\\],\\[2,5\\],\\[5,6\\],\\[6,7\\],\\[7,5\\],\\[2,6\\]\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** There are exactly three trios:\n1) \\[1,4,3\\] with degree 0.\n2) \\[2,5,6\\] with degree 2.\n3) \\[5,6,7\\] with degree 2.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= n <= 400`\n*   `edges[i].length == 2`\n*   `1 <= edges.length <= n * (n-1) / 2`\n*   `1 <= ui, vi <= n`\n*   `ui != vi`\n*   There are no repeated edges.",
