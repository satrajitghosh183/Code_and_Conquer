  "slug": "find-servers-that-handled-most-number-of-requests",
  "description": "You have `k` servers numbered from `0` to `k-1` that are being used to handle multiple requests simultaneously. Each server has infinite computational capacity but **cannot handle more than one request at a time**. The requests are assigned to servers according to a specific algorithm:\n\n*   The `ith` (0-indexed) request arrives.\n*   If all servers are busy, the request is dropped (not handled at all).\n*   If the `(i % k)th` server is available, assign the request to that server.\n*   Otherwise, assign the request to the next available server (wrapping around the list of servers and starting from 0 if necessary). For example, if the `ith` server is busy, try to assign the request to the `(i+1)th` server, then the `(i+2)th` server, and so on.\n\nYou are given a **strictly increasing** array `arrival` of positive integers, where `arrival[i]` represents the arrival time of the `ith` request, and another array `load`, where `load[i]` represents the load of the `ith` request (the time it takes to complete). Your goal is to find the **busiest server(s)**. A server is considered **busiest** if it handled the most number of requests successfully among all the servers.\n\nReturn _a list containing the IDs (0-indexed) of the **busiest server(s)**_. You may return the IDs in any order.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** k = 3, arrival = \\[1,2,3,4,5\\], load = \\[5,2,3,3,3\\] \n**Output:** \\[1\\] \n**Explanation:** \nAll of the servers start out available.\nThe first 3 requests are handled by the first 3 servers in order.\nRequest 3 comes in. Server 0 is busy, so it's assigned to the next available server, which is 1.\nRequest 4 comes in. It cannot be handled since all servers are busy, so it is dropped.\nServers 0 and 2 handled one request each, while server 1 handled two requests. Hence server 1 is the busiest server.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** k = 3, arrival = \\[1,2,3,4\\], load = \\[1,2,1,2\\]\n**Output:** \\[0\\]\n**Explanation:** \nThe first 3 requests are handled by first 3 servers.\nRequest 3 comes in. It is handled by server 0 since the server is available.\nServer 0 handled two requests, while servers 1 and 2 handled one request each. Hence server 0 is the busiest server.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** k = 3, arrival = \\[1,2,3\\], load = \\[10,12,11\\]\n**Output:** \\[0,1,2\\]\n**Explanation:** Each server handles a single request, so they are all considered the busiest.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= k <= 105`\n*   `1 <= arrival.length, load.length <= 105`\n*   `arrival.length == load.length`\n*   `1 <= arrival[i], load[i] <= 109`\n*   `arrival` is **strictly increasing**.",
