  "description": "You are given two integers `m` and `n` representing a **0-indexed** `m x n` grid. You are also given two 2D integer arrays `guards` and `walls` where `guards[i] = [rowi, coli]` and `walls[j] = [rowj, colj]` represent the positions of the `ith` guard and `jth` wall respectively.\n\nA guard can see **every** cell in the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, or west) starting from their position unless **obstructed** by a wall or another guard. A cell is **guarded** if there is **at least** one guard that can see it.\n\nReturn _the number of unoccupied cells that are **not** **guarded**._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** m = 4, n = 6, guards = \\[\\[0,0\\],\\[1,1\\],\\[2,3\\]\\], walls = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[2,2\\],\\[1,4\\]\\]\n**Output:** 7\n**Explanation:** The guarded and unguarded cells are shown in red and green respectively in the above diagram.\nThere are a total of 7 unguarded cells, so we return 7.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** m = 3, n = 3, guards = \\[\\[1,1\\]\\], walls = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[1,0\\],\\[2,1\\],\\[1,2\\]\\]\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** The unguarded cells are shown in green in the above diagram.\nThere are a total of 4 unguarded cells, so we return 4.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= m, n <= 105`\n*   `2 <= m * n <= 105`\n*   `1 <= guards.length, walls.length <= 5 * 104`\n*   `2 <= guards.length + walls.length <= m * n`\n*   `guards[i].length == walls[j].length == 2`\n*   `0 <= rowi, rowj < m`\n*   `0 <= coli, colj < n`\n*   All the positions in `guards` and `walls` are **unique**.",
