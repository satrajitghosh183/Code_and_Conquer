  "description": "There is a class with `m` students and `n` exams. You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` integer matrix `score`, where each row represents one student and `score[i][j]` denotes the score the `ith` student got in the `jth` exam. The matrix `score` contains **distinct** integers only.\n\nYou are also given an integer `k`. Sort the students (i.e., the rows of the matrix) by their scores in the `kth` (**0-indexed**) exam from the highest to the lowest.\n\nReturn _the matrix after sorting it._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** score = \\[\\[10,6,9,1\\],\\[7,5,11,2\\],\\[4,8,3,15\\]\\], k = 2\n**Output:** \\[\\[7,5,11,2\\],\\[10,6,9,1\\],\\[4,8,3,15\\]\\]\n**Explanation:** In the above diagram, S denotes the student, while E denotes the exam.\n- The student with index 1 scored 11 in exam 2, which is the highest score, so they got first place.\n- The student with index 0 scored 9 in exam 2, which is the second highest score, so they got second place.\n- The student with index 2 scored 3 in exam 2, which is the lowest score, so they got third place.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** score = \\[\\[3,4\\],\\[5,6\\]\\], k = 0\n**Output:** \\[\\[5,6\\],\\[3,4\\]\\]\n**Explanation:** In the above diagram, S denotes the student, while E denotes the exam.\n- The student with index 1 scored 5 in exam 0, which is the highest score, so they got first place.\n- The student with index 0 scored 3 in exam 0, which is the lowest score, so they got second place.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `m == score.length`\n*   `n == score[i].length`\n*   `1 <= m, n <= 250`\n*   `1 <= score[i][j] <= 105`\n*   `score` consists of **distinct** integers.\n*   `0 <= k < n`",
