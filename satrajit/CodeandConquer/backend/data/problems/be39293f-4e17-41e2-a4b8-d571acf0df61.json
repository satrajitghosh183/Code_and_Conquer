  "title": "Coordinate With Maximum Network Quality",
  "slug": "coordinate-with-maximum-network-quality",
  "description": "You are given an array of network towers `towers`, where `towers[i] = [xi, yi, qi]` denotes the `ith` network tower with location `(xi, yi)` and quality factor `qi`. All the coordinates are **integral coordinates** on the X-Y plane, and the distance between the two coordinates is the **Euclidean distance**.\n\nYou are also given an integer `radius` where a tower is **reachable** if the distance is **less than or equal to** `radius`. Outside that distance, the signal becomes garbled, and the tower is **not reachable**.\n\nThe signal quality of the `ith` tower at a coordinate `(x, y)` is calculated with the formula `⌊qi / (1 + d)⌋`, where `d` is the distance between the tower and the coordinate. The **network quality** at a coordinate is the sum of the signal qualities from all the **reachable** towers.\n\nReturn _the array_ `[cx, cy]` _representing the **integral** coordinate_ `(cx, cy)` _where the **network quality** is maximum. If there are multiple coordinates with the same **network quality**, return the lexicographically minimum **non-negative** coordinate._\n\n**Note:**\n\n*   A coordinate `(x1, y1)` is lexicographically smaller than `(x2, y2)` if either:\n    *   `x1 < x2`, or\n    *   `x1 == x2` and `y1 < y2`.\n*   `⌊val⌋` is the greatest integer less than or equal to `val` (the floor function).\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** towers = \\[\\[1,2,5\\],\\[2,1,7\\],\\[3,1,9\\]\\], radius = 2\n**Output:** \\[2,1\\]\n**Explanation:** At coordinate (2, 1) the total quality is 13.\n- Quality of 7 from (2, 1) results in ⌊7 / (1 + sqrt(0)⌋ = ⌊7⌋ = 7\n- Quality of 5 from (1, 2) results in ⌊5 / (1 + sqrt(2)⌋ = ⌊2.07⌋ = 2\n- Quality of 9 from (3, 1) results in ⌊9 / (1 + sqrt(1)⌋ = ⌊4.5⌋ = 4\nNo other coordinate has a higher network quality.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** towers = \\[\\[23,11,21\\]\\], radius = 9\n**Output:** \\[23,11\\]\n**Explanation:** Since there is only one tower, the network quality is highest right at the tower's location.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** towers = \\[\\[1,2,13\\],\\[2,1,7\\],\\[0,1,9\\]\\], radius = 2\n**Output:** \\[1,2\\]\n**Explanation:** Coordinate (1, 2) has the highest network quality.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= towers.length <= 50`\n*   `towers[i].length == 3`\n*   `0 <= xi, yi, qi <= 50`\n*   `1 <= radius <= 50`",
