  "description": "There are `n` projects numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given an integer array `milestones` where each `milestones[i]` denotes the number of milestones the `ith` project has.\n\nYou can work on the projects following these two rules:\n\n*   Every week, you will finish **exactly one** milestone of **one** project. You **must** work every week.\n*   You **cannot** work on two milestones from the same project for two **consecutive** weeks.\n\nOnce all the milestones of all the projects are finished, or if the only milestones that you can work on will cause you to violate the above rules, you will **stop working**. Note that you may not be able to finish every project's milestones due to these constraints.\n\nReturn _the **maximum** number of weeks you would be able to work on the projects without violating the rules mentioned above_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** milestones = \\[1,2,3\\]\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:** One possible scenario is:\n​​​​- During the 1st week, you will work on a milestone of project 0.\n- During the 2nd week, you will work on a milestone of project 2.\n- During the 3rd week, you will work on a milestone of project 1.\n- During the 4th week, you will work on a milestone of project 2.\n- During the 5th week, you will work on a milestone of project 1.\n- During the 6th week, you will work on a milestone of project 2.\nThe total number of weeks is 6.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** milestones = \\[5,2,1\\]\n**Output:** 7\n**Explanation:** One possible scenario is:\n- During the 1st week, you will work on a milestone of project 0.\n- During the 2nd week, you will work on a milestone of project 1.\n- During the 3rd week, you will work on a milestone of project 0.\n- During the 4th week, you will work on a milestone of project 1.\n- During the 5th week, you will work on a milestone of project 0.\n- During the 6th week, you will work on a milestone of project 2.\n- During the 7th week, you will work on a milestone of project 0.\nThe total number of weeks is 7.\nNote that you cannot work on the last milestone of project 0 on 8th week because it would violate the rules.\nThus, one milestone in project 0 will remain unfinished.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == milestones.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 105`\n*   `1 <= milestones[i] <= 109`",
