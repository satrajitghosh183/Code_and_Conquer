  "title": "Minimum Time to Visit a Cell In a Grid",
  "slug": "minimum-time-to-visit-a-cell-in-a-grid",
  "description": "You are given a `m x n` matrix `grid` consisting of **non-negative** integers where `grid[row][col]` represents the **minimum** time required to be able to visit the cell `(row, col)`, which means you can visit the cell `(row, col)` only when the time you visit it is greater than or equal to `grid[row][col]`.\n\nYou are standing in the **top-left** cell of the matrix in the `0th` second, and you must move to **any** adjacent cell in the four directions: up, down, left, and right. Each move you make takes 1 second.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** time required in which you can visit the bottom-right cell of the matrix_. If you cannot visit the bottom-right cell, then return `-1`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[0,1,3,2\\],\\[5,1,2,5\\],\\[4,3,8,6\\]\\]\n**Output:** 7\n**Explanation:** One of the paths that we can take is the following:\n- at t = 0, we are on the cell (0,0).\n- at t = 1, we move to the cell (0,1). It is possible because grid\\[0\\]\\[1\\] <= 1.\n- at t = 2, we move to the cell (1,1). It is possible because grid\\[1\\]\\[1\\] <= 2.\n- at t = 3, we move to the cell (1,2). It is possible because grid\\[1\\]\\[2\\] <= 3.\n- at t = 4, we move to the cell (1,1). It is possible because grid\\[1\\]\\[1\\] <= 4.\n- at t = 5, we move to the cell (1,2). It is possible because grid\\[1\\]\\[2\\] <= 5.\n- at t = 6, we move to the cell (1,3). It is possible because grid\\[1\\]\\[3\\] <= 6.\n- at t = 7, we move to the cell (2,3). It is possible because grid\\[2\\]\\[3\\] <= 7.\nThe final time is 7. It can be shown that it is the minimum time possible.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[0,2,4\\],\\[3,2,1\\],\\[1,0,4\\]\\]\n**Output:** -1\n**Explanation:** There is no path from the top left to the bottom-right cell.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `m == grid.length`\n*   `n == grid[i].length`\n*   `2 <= m, n <= 1000`\n*   `4 <= m * n <= 105`\n*   `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 105`\n*   `grid[0][0] == 0`\n\n.spoilerbutton {display:block; border:dashed; padding: 0px 0px; margin:10px 0px; font-size:150%; font-weight: bold; color:#000000; background-color:cyan; outline:0; } .spoiler {overflow:hidden;} .spoiler > div {-webkit-transition: all 0s ease;-moz-transition: margin 0s ease;-o-transition: all 0s ease;transition: margin 0s ease;} .spoilerbutton\\[value=\"Show Message\"\\] + .spoiler > div {margin-top:-500%;} .spoilerbutton\\[value=\"Hide Message\"\\] + .spoiler {padding:5px;}",
