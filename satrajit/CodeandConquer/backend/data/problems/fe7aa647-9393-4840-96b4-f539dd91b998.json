  "slug": "reverse-nodes-in-even-length-groups",
  "description": "You are given the `head` of a linked list.\n\nThe nodes in the linked list are **sequentially** assigned to **non-empty** groups whose lengths form the sequence of the natural numbers (`1, 2, 3, 4, ...`). The **length** of a group is the number of nodes assigned to it. In other words,\n\n*   The `1st` node is assigned to the first group.\n*   The `2nd` and the `3rd` nodes are assigned to the second group.\n*   The `4th`, `5th`, and `6th` nodes are assigned to the third group, and so on.\n\nNote that the length of the last group may be less than or equal to `1 + the length of the second to last group`.\n\n**Reverse** the nodes in each group with an **even** length, and return _the_ `head` _of the modified linked list_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** head = \\[5,2,6,3,9,1,7,3,8,4\\]\n**Output:** \\[5,6,2,3,9,1,4,8,3,7\\]\n**Explanation:**\n- The length of the first group is 1, which is odd, hence no reversal occurs.\n- The length of the second group is 2, which is even, hence the nodes are reversed.\n- The length of the third group is 3, which is odd, hence no reversal occurs.\n- The length of the last group is 4, which is even, hence the nodes are reversed.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** head = \\[1,1,0,6\\]\n**Output:** \\[1,0,1,6\\]\n**Explanation:**\n- The length of the first group is 1. No reversal occurs.\n- The length of the second group is 2. The nodes are reversed.\n- The length of the last group is 1. No reversal occurs.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** head = \\[1,1,0,6,5\\]\n**Output:** \\[1,0,1,5,6\\]\n**Explanation:**\n- The length of the first group is 1. No reversal occurs.\n- The length of the second group is 2. The nodes are reversed.\n- The length of the last group is 2. The nodes are reversed.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 105]`.\n*   `0 <= Node.val <= 105`",
