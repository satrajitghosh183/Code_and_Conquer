  "description": "There is a **binary** tree rooted at `0` consisting of `n` nodes. The nodes are labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `parents` representing the tree, where `parents[i]` is the parent of node `i`. Since node `0` is the root, `parents[0] == -1`.\n\nEach node has a **score**. To find the score of a node, consider if the node and the edges connected to it were **removed**. The tree would become one or more **non-empty** subtrees. The **size** of a subtree is the number of the nodes in it. The **score** of the node is the **product of the sizes** of all those subtrees.\n\nReturn _the **number** of nodes that have the **highest score**_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** parents = \\[-1,2,0,2,0\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:**\n- The score of node 0 is: 3 \\* 1 = 3\n- The score of node 1 is: 4 = 4\n- The score of node 2 is: 1 \\* 1 \\* 2 = 2\n- The score of node 3 is: 4 = 4\n- The score of node 4 is: 4 = 4\nThe highest score is 4, and three nodes (node 1, node 3, and node 4) have the highest score.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** parents = \\[-1,2,0\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:**\n- The score of node 0 is: 2 = 2\n- The score of node 1 is: 2 = 2\n- The score of node 2 is: 1 \\* 1 = 1\nThe highest score is 2, and two nodes (node 0 and node 1) have the highest score.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == parents.length`\n*   `2 <= n <= 105`\n*   `parents[0] == -1`\n*   `0 <= parents[i] <= n - 1` for `i != 0`\n*   `parents` represents a valid binary tree.",
