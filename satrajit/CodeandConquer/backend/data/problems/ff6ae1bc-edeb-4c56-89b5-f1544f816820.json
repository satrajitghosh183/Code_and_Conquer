  "description": "You are given two integers `memory1` and `memory2` representing the available memory in bits on two memory sticks. There is currently a faulty program running that consumes an increasing amount of memory every second.\n\nAt the `ith` second (starting from 1), `i` bits of memory are allocated to the stick with **more available memory** (or from the first memory stick if both have the same available memory). If neither stick has at least `i` bits of available memory, the program **crashes**.\n\nReturn _an array containing_ `[crashTime, memory1crash, memory2crash]`_, where_ `crashTime` _is the time (in seconds) when the program crashed and_ `memory1crash` _and_ `memory2crash` _are the available bits of memory in the first and second sticks respectively_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** memory1 = 2, memory2 = 2\n**Output:** \\[3,1,0\\]\n**Explanation:** The memory is allocated as follows:\n- At the 1st second, 1 bit of memory is allocated to stick 1. The first stick now has 1 bit of available memory.\n- At the 2nd second, 2 bits of memory are allocated to stick 2. The second stick now has 0 bits of available memory.\n- At the 3rd second, the program crashes. The sticks have 1 and 0 bits available respectively.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** memory1 = 8, memory2 = 11\n**Output:** \\[6,0,4\\]\n**Explanation:** The memory is allocated as follows:\n- At the 1st second, 1 bit of memory is allocated to stick 2. The second stick now has 10 bit of available memory.\n- At the 2nd second, 2 bits of memory are allocated to stick 2. The second stick now has 8 bits of available memory.\n- At the 3rd second, 3 bits of memory are allocated to stick 1. The first stick now has 5 bits of available memory.\n- At the 4th second, 4 bits of memory are allocated to stick 2. The second stick now has 4 bits of available memory.\n- At the 5th second, 5 bits of memory are allocated to stick 1. The first stick now has 0 bits of available memory.\n- At the 6th second, the program crashes. The sticks have 0 and 4 bits available respectively.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `0 <= memory1, memory2 <= 231 - 1`",
