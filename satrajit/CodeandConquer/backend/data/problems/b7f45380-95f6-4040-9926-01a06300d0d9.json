  "description": "You have been tasked with writing a program for a popular bank that will automate all its incoming transactions (transfer, deposit, and withdraw). The bank has `n` accounts numbered from `1` to `n`. The initial balance of each account is stored in a **0-indexed** integer array `balance`, with the `(i + 1)th` account having an initial balance of `balance[i]`.\n\nExecute all the **valid** transactions. A transaction is **valid** if:\n\n*   The given account number(s) are between `1` and `n`, and\n*   The amount of money withdrawn or transferred from is **less than or equal** to the balance of the account.\n\nImplement the `Bank` class:\n\n*   `Bank(long[] balance)` Initializes the object with the **0-indexed** integer array `balance`.\n*   `boolean transfer(int account1, int account2, long money)` Transfers `money` dollars from the account numbered `account1` to the account numbered `account2`. Return `true` if the transaction was successful, `false` otherwise.\n*   `boolean deposit(int account, long money)` Deposit `money` dollars into the account numbered `account`. Return `true` if the transaction was successful, `false` otherwise.\n*   `boolean withdraw(int account, long money)` Withdraw `money` dollars from the account numbered `account`. Return `true` if the transaction was successful, `false` otherwise.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input**\n\\[ \"Bank \",  \"withdraw \",  \"transfer \",  \"deposit \",  \"transfer \",  \"withdraw \"\\]\n\\[\\[\\[10, 100, 20, 50, 30\\]\\], \\[3, 10\\], \\[5, 1, 20\\], \\[5, 20\\], \\[3, 4, 15\\], \\[10, 50\\]\\]\n**Output**\n\\[null, true, true, true, false, false\\]\n\n**Explanation**\nBank bank = new Bank(\\[10, 100, 20, 50, 30\\]);\nbank.withdraw(3, 10);    // return true, account 3 has a balance of $20, so it is valid to withdraw $10.\n                         // Account 3 has $20 - $10 = $10.\nbank.transfer(5, 1, 20); // return true, account 5 has a balance of $30, so it is valid to transfer $20.\n                         // Account 5 has $30 - $20 = $10, and account 1 has $10 + $20 = $30.\nbank.deposit(5, 20);     // return true, it is valid to deposit $20 to account 5.\n                         // Account 5 has $10 + $20 = $30.\nbank.transfer(3, 4, 15); // return false, the current balance of account 3 is $10,\n                         // so it is invalid to transfer $15 from it.\nbank.withdraw(10, 50);   // return false, it is invalid because account 10 does not exist.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == balance.length`\n*   `1 <= n, account, account1, account2 <= 105`\n*   `0 <= balance[i], money <= 1012`\n*   At most `104` calls will be made to **each** function `transfer`, `deposit`, `withdraw`.",
