  "description": "There is a long and thin painting that can be represented by a number line. You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `paint` of length `n`, where `paint[i] = [starti, endi]`. This means that on the `ith` day you need to paint the area **between** `starti` and `endi`.\n\nPainting the same area multiple times will create an uneven painting so you only want to paint each area of the painting at most **once**.\n\nReturn _an integer array_ `worklog` _of length_ `n`_, where_ `worklog[i]` _is the amount of **new** area that you painted on the_ `ith` _day._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** paint = \\[\\[1,4\\],\\[4,7\\],\\[5,8\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[3,3,1\\]\n**Explanation:**\nOn day 0, paint everything between 1 and 4.\nThe amount of new area painted on day 0 is 4 - 1 = 3.\nOn day 1, paint everything between 4 and 7.\nThe amount of new area painted on day 1 is 7 - 4 = 3.\nOn day 2, paint everything between 7 and 8.\nEverything between 5 and 7 was already painted on day 1.\nThe amount of new area painted on day 2 is 8 - 7 = 1. \n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** paint = \\[\\[1,4\\],\\[5,8\\],\\[4,7\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[3,3,1\\]\n**Explanation:**\nOn day 0, paint everything between 1 and 4.\nThe amount of new area painted on day 0 is 4 - 1 = 3.\nOn day 1, paint everything between 5 and 8.\nThe amount of new area painted on day 1 is 8 - 5 = 3.\nOn day 2, paint everything between 4 and 5.\nEverything between 5 and 7 was already painted on day 1.\nThe amount of new area painted on day 2 is 5 - 4 = 1. \n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** paint = \\[\\[1,5\\],\\[2,4\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[4,0\\]\n**Explanation:**\nOn day 0, paint everything between 1 and 5.\nThe amount of new area painted on day 0 is 5 - 1 = 4.\nOn day 1, paint nothing because everything between 2 and 4 was already painted on day 0.\nThe amount of new area painted on day 1 is 0.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= paint.length <= 105`\n*   `paint[i].length == 2`\n*   `0 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 104`",
