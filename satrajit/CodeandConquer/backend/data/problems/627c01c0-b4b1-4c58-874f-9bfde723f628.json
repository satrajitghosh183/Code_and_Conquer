  "title": "Maximum Average Pass Ratio",
  "slug": "maximum-average-pass-ratio",
  "description": "There is a school that has classes of students and each class will be having a final exam. You are given a 2D integer array `classes`, where `classes[i] = [passi, totali]`. You know beforehand that in the `ith` class, there are `totali` total students, but only `passi` number of students will pass the exam.\n\nYou are also given an integer `extraStudents`. There are another `extraStudents` brilliant students that are **guaranteed** to pass the exam of any class they are assigned to. You want to assign each of the `extraStudents` students to a class in a way that **maximizes** the **average** pass ratio across **all** the classes.\n\nThe **pass ratio** of a class is equal to the number of students of the class that will pass the exam divided by the total number of students of the class. The **average pass ratio** is the sum of pass ratios of all the classes divided by the number of the classes.\n\nReturn _the **maximum** possible average pass ratio after assigning the_ `extraStudents` _students._ Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** classes = \\[\\[1,2\\],\\[3,5\\],\\[2,2\\]\\], `extraStudents` = 2\n**Output:** 0.78333\n**Explanation:** You can assign the two extra students to the first class. The average pass ratio will be equal to (3/4 + 3/5 + 2/2) / 3 = 0.78333.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** classes = \\[\\[2,4\\],\\[3,9\\],\\[4,5\\],\\[2,10\\]\\], `extraStudents` = 4\n**Output:** 0.53485\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= classes.length <= 105`\n*   `classes[i].length == 2`\n*   `1 <= passi <= totali <= 105`\n*   `1 <= extraStudents <= 105`",
