  "description": "You are given the `root` of a **binary tree** with the following properties:\n\n*   **Leaf nodes** have either the value `0` or `1`, representing `false` and `true` respectively.\n*   **Non-leaf nodes** have either the value `2`, `3`, `4`, or `5`, representing the boolean operations `OR`, `AND`, `XOR`, and `NOT`, respectively.\n\nYou are also given a boolean `result`, which is the desired result of the **evaluation** of the `root` node.\n\nThe evaluation of a node is as follows:\n\n*   If the node is a leaf node, the evaluation is the **value** of the node, i.e. `true` or `false`.\n*   Otherwise, **evaluate** the node's children and **apply** the boolean operation of its value with the children's evaluations.\n\nIn one operation, you can **flip** a leaf node, which causes a `false` node to become `true`, and a `true` node to become `false`.\n\nReturn _the minimum number of operations that need to be performed such that the evaluation of_ `root` _yields_ `result`. It can be shown that there is always a way to achieve `result`.\n\nA **leaf node** is a node that has zero children.\n\nNote: `NOT` nodes have either a left child or a right child, but other non-leaf nodes have both a left child and a right child.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** root = \\[3,5,4,2,null,1,1,1,0\\], result = true\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:**\nIt can be shown that a minimum of 2 nodes have to be flipped to make the root of the tree\nevaluate to true. One way to achieve this is shown in the diagram above.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** root = \\[0\\], result = false\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:**\nThe root of the tree already evaluates to false, so 0 nodes have to be flipped.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 105]`.\n*   `0 <= Node.val <= 5`\n*   `OR`, `AND`, and `XOR` nodes have `2` children.\n*   `NOT` nodes have `1` child.\n*   Leaf nodes have a value of `0` or `1`.\n*   Non-leaf nodes have a value of `2`, `3`, `4`, or `5`.",
