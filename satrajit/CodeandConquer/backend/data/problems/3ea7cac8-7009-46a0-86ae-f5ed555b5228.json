  "description": "You are given the `root` of a binary tree with **unique values**.\n\nIn one operation, you can choose any two nodes **at the same level** and swap their values.\n\nReturn _the minimum number of operations needed to make the values at each level sorted in a **strictly increasing order**_.\n\nThe **level** of a node is the number of edges along the path between it and the root node_._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** root = \\[1,4,3,7,6,8,5,null,null,null,null,9,null,10\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:**\n- Swap 4 and 3. The 2nd level becomes \\[3,4\\].\n- Swap 7 and 5. The 3rd level becomes \\[5,6,8,7\\].\n- Swap 8 and 7. The 3rd level becomes \\[5,6,7,8\\].\nWe used 3 operations so return 3.\nIt can be proven that 3 is the minimum number of operations needed.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** root = \\[1,3,2,7,6,5,4\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:**\n- Swap 3 and 2. The 2nd level becomes \\[2,3\\].\n- Swap 7 and 4. The 3rd level becomes \\[4,6,5,7\\].\n- Swap 6 and 5. The 3rd level becomes \\[4,5,6,7\\].\nWe used 3 operations so return 3.\nIt can be proven that 3 is the minimum number of operations needed.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** root = \\[1,2,3,4,5,6\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** Each level is already sorted in increasing order so return 0.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 105]`.\n*   `1 <= Node.val <= 105`\n*   All the values of the tree are **unique**.",
