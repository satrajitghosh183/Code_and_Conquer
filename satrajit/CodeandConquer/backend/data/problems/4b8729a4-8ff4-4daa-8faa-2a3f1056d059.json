  "description": "You are given a binary string `s` and a positive integer `k`.\n\nReturn _the length of the **longest** subsequence of_ `s` _that makes up a **binary** number less than or equal to_ `k`.\n\nNote:\n\n*   The subsequence can contain **leading zeroes**.\n*   The empty string is considered to be equal to `0`.\n*   A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"1001010 \", k = 5\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** The longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to 5 is  \"00010 \", as this number is equal to 2 in decimal.\nNote that  \"00100 \" and  \"00101 \" are also possible, which are equal to 4 and 5 in decimal, respectively.\nThe length of this subsequence is 5, so 5 is returned.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"00101001 \", k = 1\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:**  \"000001 \" is the longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to 1, as this number is equal to 1 in decimal.\nThe length of this subsequence is 6, so 6 is returned.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= s.length <= 1000`\n*   `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.\n*   `1 <= k <= 109`",
