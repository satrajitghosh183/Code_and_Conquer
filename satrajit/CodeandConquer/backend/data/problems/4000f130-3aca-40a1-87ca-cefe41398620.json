  "description": "Alice and Bob are opponents in an archery competition. The competition has set the following rules:\n\n1.  Alice first shoots `numArrows` arrows and then Bob shoots `numArrows` arrows.\n2.  The points are then calculated as follows:\n    1.  The target has integer scoring sections ranging from `0` to `11` **inclusive**.\n    2.  For **each** section of the target with score `k` (in between `0` to `11`), say Alice and Bob have shot `ak` and `bk` arrows on that section respectively. If `ak >= bk`, then Alice takes `k` points. If `ak < bk`, then Bob takes `k` points.\n    3.  However, if `ak == bk == 0`, then **nobody** takes `k` points.\n\n*   For example, if Alice and Bob both shot `2` arrows on the section with score `11`, then Alice takes `11` points. On the other hand, if Alice shot `0` arrows on the section with score `11` and Bob shot `2` arrows on that same section, then Bob takes `11` points.\n    \n\nYou are given the integer `numArrows` and an integer array `aliceArrows` of size `12`, which represents the number of arrows Alice shot on each scoring section from `0` to `11`. Now, Bob wants to **maximize** the total number of points he can obtain.\n\nReturn _the array_ `bobArrows` _which represents the number of arrows Bob shot on **each** scoring section from_ `0` _to_ `11`. The sum of the values in `bobArrows` should equal `numArrows`.\n\nIf there are multiple ways for Bob to earn the maximum total points, return **any** one of them.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** numArrows = 9, aliceArrows = \\[1,1,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,1,2,0\\]\n**Output:** \\[0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,2,3,1\\]\n**Explanation:** The table above shows how the competition is scored. \nBob earns a total point of 4 + 5 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 47.\nIt can be shown that Bob cannot obtain a score higher than 47 points.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** numArrows = 3, aliceArrows = \\[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\\]\n**Output:** \\[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0\\]\n**Explanation:** The table above shows how the competition is scored.\nBob earns a total point of 8 + 9 + 10 = 27.\nIt can be shown that Bob cannot obtain a score higher than 27 points.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= numArrows <= 105`\n*   `aliceArrows.length == bobArrows.length == 12`\n*   `0 <= aliceArrows[i], bobArrows[i] <= numArrows`\n*   `sum(aliceArrows[i]) == numArrows`",
