  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** binary string `s` which represents the types of buildings along a street where:\n\n*   `s[i] = '0'` denotes that the `ith` building is an office and\n*   `s[i] = '1'` denotes that the `ith` building is a restaurant.\n\nAs a city official, you would like to **select** 3 buildings for random inspection. However, to ensure variety, **no two consecutive** buildings out of the **selected** buildings can be of the same type.\n\n*   For example, given `s = \"0**0**1**1**0**1** \"`, we cannot select the `1st`, `3rd`, and `5th` buildings as that would form `\"0**11** \"` which is **not** allowed due to having two consecutive buildings of the same type.\n\nReturn _the **number of valid ways** to select 3 buildings._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"001101 \"\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:** \nThe following sets of indices selected are valid:\n- \\[0,2,4\\] from  \"**0**0**1**1**0**1 \" forms  \"010 \"\n- \\[0,3,4\\] from  \"**0**01**10**1 \" forms  \"010 \"\n- \\[1,2,4\\] from  \"0**01**1**0**1 \" forms  \"010 \"\n- \\[1,3,4\\] from  \"0**0**1**10**1 \" forms  \"010 \"\n- \\[2,4,5\\] from  \"00**1**1**01** \" forms  \"101 \"\n- \\[3,4,5\\] from  \"001**101** \" forms  \"101 \"\nNo other selection is valid. Thus, there are 6 total ways.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"11100 \"\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** It can be shown that there are no valid selections.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `3 <= s.length <= 105`\n*   `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.",
