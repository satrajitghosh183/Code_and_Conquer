  "slug": "k-highest-ranked-items-within-a-price-range",
  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `grid` of size `m x n` that represents a map of the items in a shop. The integers in the grid represent the following:\n\n*   `0` represents a wall that you cannot pass through.\n*   `1` represents an empty cell that you can freely move to and from.\n*   All other positive integers represent the price of an item in that cell. You may also freely move to and from these item cells.\n\nIt takes `1` step to travel between adjacent grid cells.\n\nYou are also given integer arrays `pricing` and `start` where `pricing = [low, high]` and `start = [row, col]` indicates that you start at the position `(row, col)` and are interested only in items with a price in the range of `[low, high]` (**inclusive**). You are further given an integer `k`.\n\nYou are interested in the **positions** of the `k` **highest-ranked** items whose prices are **within** the given price range. The rank is determined by the **first** of these criteria that is different:\n\n1.  Distance, defined as the length of the shortest path from the `start` (**shorter** distance has a higher rank).\n2.  Price (**lower** price has a higher rank, but it must be **in the price range**).\n3.  The row number (**smaller** row number has a higher rank).\n4.  The column number (**smaller** column number has a higher rank).\n\nReturn _the_ `k` _highest-ranked items within the price range **sorted** by their rank (highest to lowest)_. If there are fewer than `k` reachable items within the price range, return _**all** of them_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[1,2,0,1\\],\\[1,3,0,1\\],\\[0,2,5,1\\]\\], pricing = \\[2,5\\], start = \\[0,0\\], k = 3\n**Output:** \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[1,1\\],\\[2,1\\]\\]\n**Explanation:** You start at (0,0).\nWith a price range of \\[2,5\\], we can take items from (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) and (2,2).\nThe ranks of these items are:\n- (0,1) with distance 1\n- (1,1) with distance 2\n- (2,1) with distance 3\n- (2,2) with distance 4\nThus, the 3 highest ranked items in the price range are (0,1), (1,1), and (2,1).\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[1,2,0,1\\],\\[1,3,3,1\\],\\[0,2,5,1\\]\\], pricing = \\[2,3\\], start = \\[2,3\\], k = 2\n**Output:** \\[\\[2,1\\],\\[1,2\\]\\]\n**Explanation:** You start at (2,3).\nWith a price range of \\[2,3\\], we can take items from (0,1), (1,1), (1,2) and (2,1).\nThe ranks of these items are:\n- (2,1) with distance 2, price 2\n- (1,2) with distance 2, price 3\n- (1,1) with distance 3\n- (0,1) with distance 4\nThus, the 2 highest ranked items in the price range are (2,1) and (1,2).\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[1,1,1\\],\\[0,0,1\\],\\[2,3,4\\]\\], pricing = \\[2,3\\], start = \\[0,0\\], k = 3\n**Output:** \\[\\[2,1\\],\\[2,0\\]\\]\n**Explanation:** You start at (0,0).\nWith a price range of \\[2,3\\], we can take items from (2,0) and (2,1). \nThe ranks of these items are: \n- (2,1) with distance 5\n- (2,0) with distance 6\nThus, the 2 highest ranked items in the price range are (2,1) and (2,0). \nNote that k = 3 but there are only 2 reachable items within the price range.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `m == grid.length`\n*   `n == grid[i].length`\n*   `1 <= m, n <= 105`\n*   `1 <= m * n <= 105`\n*   `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 105`\n*   `pricing.length == 2`\n*   `2 <= low <= high <= 105`\n*   `start.length == 2`\n*   `0 <= row <= m - 1`\n*   `0 <= col <= n - 1`\n*   `grid[row][col] > 0`\n*   `1 <= k <= m * n`",
