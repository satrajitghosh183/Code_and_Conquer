  "description": "You are given a 2D integer array `ranges` where `ranges[i] = [starti, endi]` denotes that all integers between `starti` and `endi` (both **inclusive**) are contained in the `ith` range.\n\nYou are to split `ranges` into **two** (possibly empty) groups such that:\n\n*   Each range belongs to exactly one group.\n*   Any two **overlapping** ranges must belong to the **same** group.\n\nTwo ranges are said to be **overlapping** if there exists at least **one** integer that is present in both ranges.\n\n*   For example, `[1, 3]` and `[2, 5]` are overlapping because `2` and `3` occur in both ranges.\n\nReturn _the **total number** of ways to split_ `ranges` _into two groups_. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** ranges = \\[\\[6,10\\],\\[5,15\\]\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** \nThe two ranges are overlapping, so they must be in the same group.\nThus, there are two possible ways:\n- Put both the ranges together in group 1.\n- Put both the ranges together in group 2.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** ranges = \\[\\[1,3\\],\\[10,20\\],\\[2,5\\],\\[4,8\\]\\]\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** \nRanges \\[1,3\\], and \\[2,5\\] are overlapping. So, they must be in the same group.\nAgain, ranges \\[2,5\\] and \\[4,8\\] are also overlapping. So, they must also be in the same group. \nThus, there are four possible ways to group them:\n- All the ranges in group 1.\n- All the ranges in group 2.\n- Ranges \\[1,3\\], \\[2,5\\], and \\[4,8\\] in group 1 and \\[10,20\\] in group 2.\n- Ranges \\[1,3\\], \\[2,5\\], and \\[4,8\\] in group 2 and \\[10,20\\] in group 1.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= ranges.length <= 105`\n*   `ranges[i].length == 2`\n*   `0 <= starti <= endi <= 109`",
