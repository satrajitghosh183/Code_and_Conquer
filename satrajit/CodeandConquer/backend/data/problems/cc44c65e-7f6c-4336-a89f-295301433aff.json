  "title": "Longest Ideal Subsequence",
  "slug": "longest-ideal-subsequence",
  "description": "You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase letters and an integer `k`. We call a string `t` **ideal** if the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n*   `t` is a **subsequence** of the string `s`.\n*   The absolute difference in the alphabet order of every two **adjacent** letters in `t` is less than or equal to `k`.\n\nReturn _the length of the **longest** ideal string_.\n\nA **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.\n\n**Note** that the alphabet order is not cyclic. For example, the absolute difference in the alphabet order of `'a'` and `'z'` is `25`, not `1`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"acfgbd \", k = 2\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** The longest ideal string is  \"acbd \". The length of this string is 4, so 4 is returned.\nNote that  \"acfgbd \" is not ideal because 'c' and 'f' have a difference of 3 in alphabet order.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"abcd \", k = 3\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** The longest ideal string is  \"abcd \". The length of this string is 4, so 4 is returned.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= s.length <= 105`\n*   `0 <= k <= 25`\n*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters.",
