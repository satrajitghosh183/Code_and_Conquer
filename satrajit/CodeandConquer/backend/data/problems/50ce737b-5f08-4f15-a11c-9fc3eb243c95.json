  "description": "There are `n` buildings in a line. You are given an integer array `heights` of size `n` that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.\n\nThe ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a **smaller** height.\n\nReturn a list of indices **(0-indexed)** of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** heights = \\[4,2,3,1\\]\n**Output:** \\[0,2,3\\]\n**Explanation:** Building 1 (0-indexed) does not have an ocean view because building 2 is taller.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** heights = \\[4,3,2,1\\]\n**Output:** \\[0,1,2,3\\]\n**Explanation:** All the buildings have an ocean view.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** heights = \\[1,3,2,4\\]\n**Output:** \\[3\\]\n**Explanation:** Only building 3 has an ocean view.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= heights.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= heights[i] <= 109`",
