  "description": "Given the `root` of a binary tree and a `leaf` node, reroot the tree so that the `leaf` is the new root.\n\nYou can reroot the tree with the following steps for each node `cur` on the path **starting from the** `leaf` up to the `root`​​​ **excluding the root**:\n\n1.  If `cur` has a left child, then that child becomes `cur`'s right child.\n2.  `cur`'s original parent becomes `cur`'s left child. Note that in this process the original parent's pointer to `cur` becomes `null`, making it have at most one child.\n\nReturn _the new root_ _of the rerooted tree._\n\n**Note:** Ensure that your solution sets the `Node.parent` pointers correctly after rerooting or you will receive \"Wrong Answer \".\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** root = \\[3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4\\], leaf = 7\n**Output:** \\[7,2,null,5,4,3,6,null,null,null,1,null,null,0,8\\]\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** root = \\[3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4\\], leaf = 0\n**Output:** \\[0,1,null,3,8,5,null,null,null,6,2,null,null,7,4\\]\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 100]`.\n*   `-109 <= Node.val <= 109`\n*   All `Node.val` are **unique**.\n*   `leaf` exist in the tree.",
