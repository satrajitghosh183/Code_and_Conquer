  "description": "You are given a positive integer `n`, that is initially placed on a board. Every day, for `109` days, you perform the following procedure:\n\n*   For each number `x` present on the board, find all numbers `1 <= i <= n` such that `x % i == 1`.\n*   Then, place those numbers on the board.\n\nReturn _the number of **distinct** integers present on the board after_ `109` _days have elapsed_.\n\n**Note:**\n\n*   Once a number is placed on the board, it will remain on it until the end.\n*   `%` stands for the modulo operation. For example, `14 % 3` is `2`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 5\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** Initially, 5 is present on the board. \nThe next day, 2 and 4 will be added since 5 % 2 == 1 and 5 % 4 == 1. \nAfter that day, 3 will be added to the board because 4 % 3 == 1. \nAt the end of a billion days, the distinct numbers on the board will be 2, 3, 4, and 5. \n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 3\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** \nSince 3 % 2 == 1, 2 will be added to the board. \nAfter a billion days, the only two distinct numbers on the board are 2 and 3. \n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= n <= 100`",
