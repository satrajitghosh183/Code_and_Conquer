  "slug": "get-biggest-three-rhombus-sums-in-a-grid",
  "description": "You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`​​​.\n\nA **rhombus sum** is the sum of the elements that form **the** **border** of a regular rhombus shape in `grid`​​​. The rhombus must have the shape of a square rotated 45 degrees with each of the corners centered in a grid cell. Below is an image of four valid rhombus shapes with the corresponding colored cells that should be included in each **rhombus sum**:\n\nNote that the rhombus can have an area of 0, which is depicted by the purple rhombus in the bottom right corner.\n\nReturn _the biggest three **distinct rhombus sums** in the_ `grid` _in **descending order**__. If there are less than three distinct values, return all of them_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[3,4,5,1,3\\],\\[3,3,4,2,3\\],\\[20,30,200,40,10\\],\\[1,5,5,4,1\\],\\[4,3,2,2,5\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[228,216,211\\]\n**Explanation:** The rhombus shapes for the three biggest distinct rhombus sums are depicted above.\n- Blue: 20 + 3 + 200 + 5 = 228\n- Red: 200 + 2 + 10 + 4 = 216\n- Green: 5 + 200 + 4 + 2 = 211\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[1,2,3\\],\\[4,5,6\\],\\[7,8,9\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[20,9,8\\]\n**Explanation:** The rhombus shapes for the three biggest distinct rhombus sums are depicted above.\n- Blue: 4 + 2 + 6 + 8 = 20\n- Red: 9 (area 0 rhombus in the bottom right corner)\n- Green: 8 (area 0 rhombus in the bottom middle)\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[7,7,7\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[7\\]\n**Explanation:** All three possible rhombus sums are the same, so return \\[7\\].\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `m == grid.length`\n*   `n == grid[i].length`\n*   `1 <= m, n <= 50`\n*   `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 105`",
