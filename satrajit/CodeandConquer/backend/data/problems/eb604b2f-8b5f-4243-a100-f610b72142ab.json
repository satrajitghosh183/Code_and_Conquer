  "description": "You are given an integer array `rolls` of length `n` and an integer `k`. You roll a `k` sided dice numbered from `1` to `k`, `n` times, where the result of the `ith` roll is `rolls[i]`.\n\nReturn _the length of the **shortest** sequence of rolls that **cannot** be taken from_ `rolls`.\n\nA **sequence of rolls** of length `len` is the result of rolling a `k` sided dice `len` times.\n\n**Note** that the sequence taken does not have to be consecutive as long as it is in order.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** rolls = \\[4,2,1,2,3,3,2,4,1\\], k = 4\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** Every sequence of rolls of length 1, \\[1\\], \\[2\\], \\[3\\], \\[4\\], can be taken from rolls.\nEvery sequence of rolls of length 2, \\[1, 1\\], \\[1, 2\\], ..., \\[4, 4\\], can be taken from rolls.\nThe sequence \\[1, 4, 2\\] cannot be taken from rolls, so we return 3.\nNote that there are other sequences that cannot be taken from rolls.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** rolls = \\[1,1,2,2\\], k = 2\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** Every sequence of rolls of length 1, \\[1\\], \\[2\\], can be taken from rolls.\nThe sequence \\[2, 1\\] cannot be taken from rolls, so we return 2.\nNote that there are other sequences that cannot be taken from rolls but \\[2, 1\\] is the shortest.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** rolls = \\[1,1,3,2,2,2,3,3\\], k = 4\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** The sequence \\[4\\] cannot be taken from rolls, so we return 1.\nNote that there are other sequences that cannot be taken from rolls but \\[4\\] is the shortest.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == rolls.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 105`\n*   `1 <= rolls[i] <= k <= 105`",
