  "description": "You are given an integer array `power` where `power[i]` is the power of the `ith` monster.\n\nYou start with `0` mana points, and each day you increase your mana points by `gain` where `gain` initially is equal to `1`.\n\nEach day, after gaining `gain` mana, you can defeat a monster if your mana points are greater than or equal to the power of that monster. When you defeat a monster:\n\n*   your mana points will be reset to `0`, and\n*   the value of `gain` increases by `1`.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** number of days needed to defeat all the monsters._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** power = \\[3,1,4\\]\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** The optimal way to beat all the monsters is to:\n- Day 1: Gain 1 mana point to get a total of 1 mana point. Spend all mana points to kill the 2nd monster.\n- Day 2: Gain 2 mana points to get a total of 2 mana points.\n- Day 3: Gain 2 mana points to get a total of 4 mana points. Spend all mana points to kill the 3rd monster.\n- Day 4: Gain 3 mana points to get a total of 3 mana points. Spend all mana points to kill the 1st monster.\nIt can be proven that 4 is the minimum number of days needed. \n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** power = \\[1,1,4\\]\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** The optimal way to beat all the monsters is to:\n- Day 1: Gain 1 mana point to get a total of 1 mana point. Spend all mana points to kill the 1st monster.\n- Day 2: Gain 2 mana points to get a total of 2 mana points. Spend all mana points to kill the 2nd monster.\n- Day 3: Gain 3 mana points to get a total of 3 mana points.\n- Day 4: Gain 3 mana points to get a total of 6 mana points. Spend all mana points to kill the 3rd monster.\nIt can be proven that 4 is the minimum number of days needed. \n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** power = \\[1,2,4,9\\]\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:** The optimal way to beat all the monsters is to:\n- Day 1: Gain 1 mana point to get a total of 1 mana point. Spend all mana points to kill the 1st monster.\n- Day 2: Gain 2 mana points to get a total of 2 mana points. Spend all mana points to kill the 2nd monster.\n- Day 3: Gain 3 mana points to get a total of 3 mana points.\n- Day 4: Gain 3 mana points to get a total of 6 mana points.\n- Day 5: Gain 3 mana points to get a total of 9 mana points. Spend all mana points to kill the 4th monster.\n- Day 6: Gain 4 mana points to get a total of 4 mana points. Spend all mana points to kill the 3rd monster.\nIt can be proven that 6 is the minimum number of days needed.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= power.length <= 17`\n*   `1 <= power[i] <= 109`",
