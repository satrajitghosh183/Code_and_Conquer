  "slug": "removing-minimum-and-maximum-from-array",
  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** array of **distinct** integers `nums`.\n\nThere is an element in `nums` that has the **lowest** value and an element that has the **highest** value. We call them the **minimum** and **maximum** respectively. Your goal is to remove **both** these elements from the array.\n\nA **deletion** is defined as either removing an element from the **front** of the array or removing an element from the **back** of the array.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** number of deletions it would take to remove **both** the minimum and maximum element from the array._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[2,**10**,7,5,4,**1**,8,6\\]\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** \nThe minimum element in the array is nums\\[5\\], which is 1.\nThe maximum element in the array is nums\\[1\\], which is 10.\nWe can remove both the minimum and maximum by removing 2 elements from the front and 3 elements from the back.\nThis results in 2 + 3 = 5 deletions, which is the minimum number possible.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[0,**\\-4**,**19**,1,8,-2,-3,5\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** \nThe minimum element in the array is nums\\[1\\], which is -4.\nThe maximum element in the array is nums\\[2\\], which is 19.\nWe can remove both the minimum and maximum by removing 3 elements from the front.\nThis results in only 3 deletions, which is the minimum number possible.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[**101**\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:**  \nThere is only one element in the array, which makes it both the minimum and maximum element.\nWe can remove it with 1 deletion.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`\n*   `-105 <= nums[i] <= 105`\n*   The integers in `nums` are **distinct**.",
