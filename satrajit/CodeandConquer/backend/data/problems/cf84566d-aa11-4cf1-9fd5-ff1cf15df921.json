  "description": "You are given an integer `n` indicating there are `n` people numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `meetings` where `meetings[i] = [xi, yi, timei]` indicates that person `xi` and person `yi` have a meeting at `timei`. A person may attend **multiple meetings** at the same time. Finally, you are given an integer `firstPerson`.\n\nPerson `0` has a **secret** and initially shares the secret with a person `firstPerson` at time `0`. This secret is then shared every time a meeting takes place with a person that has the secret. More formally, for every meeting, if a person `xi` has the secret at `timei`, then they will share the secret with person `yi`, and vice versa.\n\nThe secrets are shared **instantaneously**. That is, a person may receive the secret and share it with people in other meetings within the same time frame.\n\nReturn _a list of all the people that have the secret after all the meetings have taken place._ You may return the answer in **any order**.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 6, meetings = \\[\\[1,2,5\\],\\[2,3,8\\],\\[1,5,10\\]\\], firstPerson = 1\n**Output:** \\[0,1,2,3,5\\]\n**Explanation:**\nAt time 0, person 0 shares the secret with person 1.\nAt time 5, person 1 shares the secret with person 2.\nAt time 8, person 2 shares the secret with person 3.\nAt time 10, person 1 shares the secret with person 5.​​​​\nThus, people 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 know the secret after all the meetings.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 4, meetings = \\[\\[3,1,3\\],\\[1,2,2\\],\\[0,3,3\\]\\], firstPerson = 3\n**Output:** \\[0,1,3\\]\n**Explanation:**\nAt time 0, person 0 shares the secret with person 3.\nAt time 2, neither person 1 nor person 2 know the secret.\nAt time 3, person 3 shares the secret with person 0 and person 1.\nThus, people 0, 1, and 3 know the secret after all the meetings.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** n = 5, meetings = \\[\\[3,4,2\\],\\[1,2,1\\],\\[2,3,1\\]\\], firstPerson = 1\n**Output:** \\[0,1,2,3,4\\]\n**Explanation:**\nAt time 0, person 0 shares the secret with person 1.\nAt time 1, person 1 shares the secret with person 2, and person 2 shares the secret with person 3.\nNote that person 2 can share the secret at the same time as receiving it.\nAt time 2, person 3 shares the secret with person 4.\nThus, people 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 know the secret after all the meetings.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= n <= 105`\n*   `1 <= meetings.length <= 105`\n*   `meetings[i].length == 3`\n*   `0 <= xi, yi <= n - 1`\n*   `xi != yi`\n*   `1 <= timei <= 105`\n*   `1 <= firstPerson <= n - 1`",
