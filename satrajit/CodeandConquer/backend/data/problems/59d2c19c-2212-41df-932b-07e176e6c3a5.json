  "description": "There is a programming language with only **four** operations and **one** variable `X`:\n\n*   `++X` and `X++` **increments** the value of the variable `X` by `1`.\n*   `--X` and `X--` **decrements** the value of the variable `X` by `1`.\n\nInitially, the value of `X` is `0`.\n\nGiven an array of strings `operations` containing a list of operations, return _the **final** value of_ `X` _after performing all the operations_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** operations = \\[ \"--X \", \"X++ \", \"X++ \"\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** The operations are performed as follows:\nInitially, X = 0.\n--X: X is decremented by 1, X =  0 - 1 = -1.\nX++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 =  0.\nX++: X is incremented by 1, X =  0 + 1 =  1.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** operations = \\[ \"++X \", \"++X \", \"X++ \"\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** The operations are performed as follows:\nInitially, X = 0.\n++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.\n++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.\nX++: X is incremented by 1, X = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** operations = \\[ \"X++ \", \"++X \", \"--X \", \"X-- \"\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** The operations are performed as follows:\nInitially, X = 0.\nX++: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.\n++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.\n--X: X is decremented by 1, X = 2 - 1 = 1.\nX--: X is decremented by 1, X = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= operations.length <= 100`\n*   `operations[i]` will be either `\"++X \"`, `\"X++ \"`, `\"--X \"`, or `\"X-- \"`.",
