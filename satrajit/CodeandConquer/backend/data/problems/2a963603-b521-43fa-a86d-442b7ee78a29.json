  "description": "Fruits are available at some positions on an infinite x-axis. You are given a 2D integer array `fruits` where `fruits[i] = [positioni, amounti]` depicts `amounti` fruits at the position `positioni`. `fruits` is already **sorted** by `positioni` in **ascending order**, and each `positioni` is **unique**.\n\nYou are also given an integer `startPos` and an integer `k`. Initially, you are at the position `startPos`. From any position, you can either walk to the **left or right**. It takes **one step** to move **one unit** on the x-axis, and you can walk **at most** `k` steps in total. For every position you reach, you harvest all the fruits at that position, and the fruits will disappear from that position.\n\nReturn _the **maximum total number** of fruits you can harvest_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** fruits = \\[\\[2,8\\],\\[6,3\\],\\[8,6\\]\\], startPos = 5, k = 4\n**Output:** 9\n**Explanation:** \nThe optimal way is to:\n- Move right to position 6 and harvest 3 fruits\n- Move right to position 8 and harvest 6 fruits\nYou moved 3 steps and harvested 3 + 6 = 9 fruits in total.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** fruits = \\[\\[0,9\\],\\[4,1\\],\\[5,7\\],\\[6,2\\],\\[7,4\\],\\[10,9\\]\\], startPos = 5, k = 4\n**Output:** 14\n**Explanation:** \nYou can move at most k = 4 steps, so you cannot reach position 0 nor 10.\nThe optimal way is to:\n- Harvest the 7 fruits at the starting position 5\n- Move left to position 4 and harvest 1 fruit\n- Move right to position 6 and harvest 2 fruits\n- Move right to position 7 and harvest 4 fruits\nYou moved 1 + 3 = 4 steps and harvested 7 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 14 fruits in total.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** fruits = \\[\\[0,3\\],\\[6,4\\],\\[8,5\\]\\], startPos = 3, k = 2\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:**\nYou can move at most k = 2 steps and cannot reach any position with fruits.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= fruits.length <= 105`\n*   `fruits[i].length == 2`\n*   `0 <= startPos, positioni <= 2 * 105`\n*   `positioni-1 < positioni` for any `i > 0` (**0-indexed**)\n*   `1 <= amounti <= 104`\n*   `0 <= k <= 2 * 105`",
