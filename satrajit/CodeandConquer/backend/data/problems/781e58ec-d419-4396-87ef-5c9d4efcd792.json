  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** binary matrix `grid`. In one operation, you can flip any `1` in `grid` to be `0`.\n\nA binary matrix is **well-isolated** if there is no `1` in the matrix that is **4-directionally connected** (i.e., horizontal and vertical) to another `1`.\n\nReturn _the minimum number of operations to make_ `grid` _**well-isolated**_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[1,1,0\\],\\[0,1,1\\],\\[1,1,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** Use 3 operations to change grid\\[0\\]\\[1\\], grid\\[1\\]\\[2\\], and grid\\[2\\]\\[1\\] to 0.\nAfter, no more 1's are 4-directionally connected and grid is well-isolated.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[0,0,0\\],\\[0,0,0\\],\\[0,0,0\\]\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** There are no 1's in grid and it is well-isolated.\nNo operations were done so return 0.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[1,0\\]\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** None of the 1's are 4-directionally connected and grid is well-isolated.\nNo operations were done so return 0.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `m == grid.length`\n*   `n == grid[i].length`\n*   `1 <= m, n <= 300`\n*   `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.",
