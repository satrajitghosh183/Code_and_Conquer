  "description": "A **Fibonacci** tree is a binary tree created using the order function `order(n)`:\n\n*   `order(0)` is the empty tree.\n*   `order(1)` is a binary tree with only **one node**.\n*   `order(n)` is a binary tree that consists of a root node with the left subtree as `order(n - 2)` and the right subtree as `order(n - 1)`.\n\nAlice and Bob are playing a game with a **Fibonacci** tree with Alice staring first. On each turn, a player selects a node and removes that node **and** its subtree. The player that is forced to delete `root` loses.\n\nGiven the integer `n`, return `true` if Alice wins the game or `false` if Bob wins, assuming both players play optimally.\n\nA subtree of a binary tree `tree` is a tree that consists of a node in `tree` and all of this node's descendants. The tree `tree` could also be considered as a subtree of itself.\n\n**Example 1:**  \n\n**Input:** n = 3\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:**\nAlice takes the node 1 in the right subtree.\nBob takes either the 1 in the left subtree or the 2 in the right subtree.\nAlice takes whichever node Bob doesn't take.\nBob is forced to take the root node 3, so Bob will lose.\nReturn true because Alice wins.\n\n**Example 2:**  \n\n**Input:** n = 1\n**Output:** false\n**Explanation:**\nAlice is forced to take the root node 1, so Alice will lose.\nReturn false because Alice loses.\n\n**Example 3:**  \n\n**Input:** n = 2\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:**\nAlice takes the node 1.\nBob is forced to take the root node 2, so Bob will lose.\nReturn true because Alice wins.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= n <= 100`",
