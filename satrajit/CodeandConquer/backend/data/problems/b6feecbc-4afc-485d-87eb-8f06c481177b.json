  "description": "You are given an integer `n` denoting the number of cities in a country. The cities are numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.\n\nYou are also given a 2D integer array `roads` where `roads[i] = [ai, bi]` denotes that there exists a **bidirectional** road connecting cities `ai` and `bi`.\n\nYou need to assign each city with an integer value from `1` to `n`, where each value can only be used **once**. The **importance** of a road is then defined as the **sum** of the values of the two cities it connects.\n\nReturn _the **maximum total importance** of all roads possible after assigning the values optimally._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 5, roads = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[2,3\\],\\[0,2\\],\\[1,3\\],\\[2,4\\]\\]\n**Output:** 43\n**Explanation:** The figure above shows the country and the assigned values of \\[2,4,5,3,1\\].\n- The road (0,1) has an importance of 2 + 4 = 6.\n- The road (1,2) has an importance of 4 + 5 = 9.\n- The road (2,3) has an importance of 5 + 3 = 8.\n- The road (0,2) has an importance of 2 + 5 = 7.\n- The road (1,3) has an importance of 4 + 3 = 7.\n- The road (2,4) has an importance of 5 + 1 = 6.\nThe total importance of all roads is 6 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 7 + 6 = 43.\nIt can be shown that we cannot obtain a greater total importance than 43.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 5, roads = \\[\\[0,3\\],\\[2,4\\],\\[1,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** 20\n**Explanation:** The figure above shows the country and the assigned values of \\[4,3,2,5,1\\].\n- The road (0,3) has an importance of 4 + 5 = 9.\n- The road (2,4) has an importance of 2 + 1 = 3.\n- The road (1,3) has an importance of 3 + 5 = 8.\nThe total importance of all roads is 9 + 3 + 8 = 20.\nIt can be shown that we cannot obtain a greater total importance than 20.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= n <= 5 * 104`\n*   `1 <= roads.length <= 5 * 104`\n*   `roads[i].length == 2`\n*   `0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1`\n*   `ai != bi`\n*   There are no duplicate roads.",
