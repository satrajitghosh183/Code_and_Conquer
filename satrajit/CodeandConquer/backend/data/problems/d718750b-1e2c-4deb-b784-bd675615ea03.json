  "description": "It is a sweltering summer day, and a boy wants to buy some ice cream bars.\n\nAt the store, there are `n` ice cream bars. You are given an array `costs` of length `n`, where `costs[i]` is the price of the `ith` ice cream bar in coins. The boy initially has `coins` coins to spend, and he wants to buy as many ice cream bars as possible.\n\n**Note:** The boy can buy the ice cream bars in any order.\n\nReturn _the **maximum** number of ice cream bars the boy can buy with_ `coins` _coins._\n\nYou must solve the problem by counting sort.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** costs = \\[1,3,2,4,1\\], coins = 7\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** The boy can buy ice cream bars at indices 0,1,2,4 for a total price of 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 7.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** costs = \\[10,6,8,7,7,8\\], coins = 5\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** The boy cannot afford any of the ice cream bars.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** costs = \\[1,6,3,1,2,5\\], coins = 20\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:** The boy can buy all the ice cream bars for a total price of 1 + 6 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 18.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `costs.length == n`\n*   `1 <= n <= 105`\n*   `1 <= costs[i] <= 105`\n*   `1 <= coins <= 108`",
