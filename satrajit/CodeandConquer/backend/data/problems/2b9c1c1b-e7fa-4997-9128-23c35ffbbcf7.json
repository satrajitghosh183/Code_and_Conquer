  "description": "You are given a binary string `s`. You are allowed to perform two types of operations on the string in any sequence:\n\n*   **Type-1: Remove** the character at the start of the string `s` and **append** it to the end of the string.\n*   **Type-2: Pick** any character in `s` and **flip** its value, i.e., if its value is `'0'` it becomes `'1'` and vice-versa.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** number of **type-2** operations you need to perform_ _such that_ `s` _becomes **alternating**._\n\nThe string is called **alternating** if no two adjacent characters are equal.\n\n*   For example, the strings `\"010 \"` and `\"1010 \"` are alternating, while the string `\"0100 \"` is not.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"111000 \"\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation**: Use the first operation two times to make s =  \"100011 \".\nThen, use the second operation on the third and sixth elements to make s =  \"101010 \".\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"010 \"\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation**: The string is already alternating.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"1110 \"\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation**: Use the second operation on the second element to make s =  \"1010 \".\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= s.length <= 105`\n*   `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.",
