  "description": "You are given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `distance`. A pair of two different **leaf** nodes of a binary tree is said to be good if the length of **the shortest path** between them is less than or equal to `distance`.\n\nReturn _the number of good leaf node pairs_ in the tree.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** root = \\[1,2,3,null,4\\], distance = 3\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** The leaf nodes of the tree are 3 and 4 and the length of the shortest path between them is 3. This is the only good pair.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** root = \\[1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\], distance = 3\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** The good pairs are \\[4,5\\] and \\[6,7\\] with shortest path = 2. The pair \\[4,6\\] is not good because the length of ther shortest path between them is 4.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** root = \\[7,1,4,6,null,5,3,null,null,null,null,null,2\\], distance = 3\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** The only good pair is \\[2,5\\].\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   The number of nodes in the `tree` is in the range `[1, 210].`\n*   `1 <= Node.val <= 100`\n*   `1 <= distance <= 10`",
