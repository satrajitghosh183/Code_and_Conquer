  "description": "An original string, consisting of lowercase English letters, can be encoded by the following steps:\n\n*   Arbitrarily **split** it into a **sequence** of some number of **non-empty** substrings.\n*   Arbitrarily choose some elements (possibly none) of the sequence, and **replace** each with **its length** (as a numeric string).\n*   **Concatenate** the sequence as the encoded string.\n\nFor example, **one way** to encode an original string `\"abcdefghijklmnop \"` might be:\n\n*   Split it as a sequence: `[ \"ab \", \"cdefghijklmn \", \"o \", \"p \"]`.\n*   Choose the second and third elements to be replaced by their lengths, respectively. The sequence becomes `[ \"ab \", \"12 \", \"1 \", \"p \"]`.\n*   Concatenate the elements of the sequence to get the encoded string: `\"ab121p \"`.\n\nGiven two encoded strings `s1` and `s2`, consisting of lowercase English letters and digits `1-9` (inclusive), return `true` _if there exists an original string that could be encoded as **both**_ `s1` _and_ `s2`_. Otherwise, return_ `false`.\n\n**Note**: The test cases are generated such that the number of consecutive digits in `s1` and `s2` does not exceed `3`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s1 =  \"internationalization \", s2 =  \"i18n \"\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:** It is possible that  \"internationalization \" was the original string.\n-  \"internationalization \" \n  -> Split:       \\[ \"internationalization \"\\]\n  -> Do not replace any element\n  -> Concatenate:   \"internationalization \", which is s1.\n-  \"internationalization \"\n  -> Split:       \\[ \"i \",  \"nternationalizatio \",  \"n \"\\]\n  -> Replace:     \\[ \"i \",  \"18 \",                  \"n \"\\]\n  -> Concatenate:   \"i18n \", which is s2\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s1 =  \"l123e \", s2 =  \"44 \"\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:** It is possible that  \"leetcode \" was the original string.\n-  \"leetcode \" \n  -> Split:      \\[ \"l \",  \"e \",  \"et \",  \"cod \",  \"e \"\\]\n  -> Replace:    \\[ \"l \",  \"1 \",  \"2 \",   \"3 \",    \"e \"\\]\n  -> Concatenate:  \"l123e \", which is s1.\n-  \"leetcode \" \n  -> Split:      \\[ \"leet \",  \"code \"\\]\n  -> Replace:    \\[ \"4 \",     \"4 \"\\]\n  -> Concatenate:  \"44 \", which is s2.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** s1 =  \"a5b \", s2 =  \"c5b \"\n**Output:** false\n**Explanation:** It is impossible.\n- The original string encoded as s1 must start with the letter 'a'.\n- The original string encoded as s2 must start with the letter 'c'.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 40`\n*   `s1` and `s2` consist of digits `1-9` (inclusive), and lowercase English letters only.\n*   The number of consecutive digits in `s1` and `s2` does not exceed `3`.",
