  "title": "Minimum Reverse Operations",
  "slug": "minimum-reverse-operations",
  "description": "You are given an integer `n` and an integer `p` in the range `[0, n - 1]`. Representing a **0-indexed** array `arr` of length `n` where all positions are set to `0`'s, except position `p` which is set to `1`.\n\nYou are also given an integer array `banned` containing some positions from the array. For the **i****th** position in `banned`, `arr[banned[i]] = 0`, and `banned[i] != p`.\n\nYou can perform **multiple** operations on `arr`. In an operation, you can choose a **subarray** with size `k` and **reverse** the subarray. However, the `1` in `arr` should never go to any of the positions in `banned`. In other words, after each operation `arr[banned[i]]` **remains** `0`.\n\n_Return an array_ `ans` _where_ _for each_ `i` _from_ `[0, n - 1]`, `ans[i]` _is the **minimum** number of reverse operations needed to bring the_ `1` _to position_ `i` _in arr_, _or_ `-1` _if it is impossible_.\n\n*   A **subarray** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of elements within an array.\n*   The values of `ans[i]` are independent for all `i`'s.\n*   The **reverse** of an array is an array containing the values in **reverse order**.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 4, p = 0, banned = \\[1,2\\], k = 4\n**Output:** \\[0,-1,-1,1\\]\n**Explanation:** In this case `k = 4` so there is only one possible reverse operation we can perform, which is reversing the whole array. Initially, 1 is placed at position 0 so the amount of operations we need for position 0 is `0`. We can never place a 1 on the banned positions, so the answer for positions 1 and 2 is `-1`. Finally, with one reverse operation we can bring the 1 to index 3, so the answer for position 3 is `1`. \n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 5, p = 0, banned = \\[2,4\\], k = 3\n**Output:** \\[0,-1,-1,-1,-1\\]\n**Explanation:** In this case the 1 is initially at position 0, so the answer for that position is `0`. We can perform reverse operations of size 3. The 1 is currently located at position 0, so we need to reverse the subarray `[0, 2]` for it to leave that position, but reversing that subarray makes position 2 have a 1, which shouldn't happen. So, we can't move the 1 from position 0, making the result for all the other positions `-1`. \n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** n = 4, p = 2, banned = \\[0,1,3\\], k = 1\n**Output:** \\[-1,-1,0,-1\\]\n**Explanation:** In this case we can only perform reverse operations of size 1. So the 1 never changes its position.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= n <= 105`\n*   `0 <= p <= n - 1`\n*   `0 <= banned.length <= n - 1`\n*   `0 <= banned[i] <= n - 1`\n*   `1 <= k <= n`\n*   `banned[i] != p`\n*   all values in `banned` are **unique**",
