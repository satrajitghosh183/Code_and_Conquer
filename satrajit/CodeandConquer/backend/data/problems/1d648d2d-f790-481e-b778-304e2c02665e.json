  "description": "You are playing a game that has `n` levels numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `damage` where `damage[i]` is the amount of health you will lose to complete the `ith` level.\n\nYou are also given an integer `armor`. You may use your armor ability **at most once** during the game on **any** level which will protect you from **at most** `armor` damage.\n\nYou must complete the levels in order and your health must be **greater than** `0` at all times to beat the game.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** health you need to start with to beat the game._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** damage = \\[2,7,4,3\\], armor = 4\n**Output:** 13\n**Explanation:** One optimal way to beat the game starting at 13 health is:\nOn round 1, take 2 damage. You have 13 - 2 = 11 health.\nOn round 2, take 7 damage. You have 11 - 7 = 4 health.\nOn round 3, use your armor to protect you from 4 damage. You have 4 - 0 = 4 health.\nOn round 4, take 3 damage. You have 4 - 3 = 1 health.\nNote that 13 is the minimum health you need to start with to beat the game.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** damage = \\[2,5,3,4\\], armor = 7\n**Output:** 10\n**Explanation:** One optimal way to beat the game starting at 10 health is:\nOn round 1, take 2 damage. You have 10 - 2 = 8 health.\nOn round 2, use your armor to protect you from 5 damage. You have 8 - 0 = 8 health.\nOn round 3, take 3 damage. You have 8 - 3 = 5 health.\nOn round 4, take 4 damage. You have 5 - 4 = 1 health.\nNote that 10 is the minimum health you need to start with to beat the game.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** damage = \\[3,3,3\\], armor = 0\n**Output:** 10\n**Explanation:** One optimal way to beat the game starting at 10 health is:\nOn round 1, take 3 damage. You have 10 - 3 = 7 health.\nOn round 2, take 3 damage. You have 7 - 3 = 4 health.\nOn round 3, take 3 damage. You have 4 - 3 = 1 health.\nNote that you did not use your armor ability.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == damage.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 105`\n*   `0 <= damage[i] <= 105`\n*   `0 <= armor <= 105`",
