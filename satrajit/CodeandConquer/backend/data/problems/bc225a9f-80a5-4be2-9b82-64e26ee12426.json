  "description": "You have `n` packages that you are trying to place in boxes, **one package in each box**. There are `m` suppliers that each produce boxes of **different sizes** (with infinite supply). A package can be placed in a box if the size of the package is **less than or equal to** the size of the box.\n\nThe package sizes are given as an integer array `packages`, where `packages[i]` is the **size** of the `ith` package. The suppliers are given as a 2D integer array `boxes`, where `boxes[j]` is an array of **box sizes** that the `jth` supplier produces.\n\nYou want to choose a **single supplier** and use boxes from them such that the **total wasted space** is **minimized**. For each package in a box, we define the space **wasted** to be `size of the box - size of the package`. The **total wasted space** is the sum of the space wasted in **all** the boxes.\n\n*   For example, if you have to fit packages with sizes `[2,3,5]` and the supplier offers boxes of sizes `[4,8]`, you can fit the packages of size-`2` and size-`3` into two boxes of size-`4` and the package with size-`5` into a box of size-`8`. This would result in a waste of `(4-2) + (4-3) + (8-5) = 6`.\n\nReturn _the **minimum total wasted space** by choosing the box supplier **optimally**, or_ `-1` _if it is **impossible** to fit all the packages inside boxes._ Since the answer may be **large**, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** packages = \\[2,3,5\\], boxes = \\[\\[4,8\\],\\[2,8\\]\\]\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation**: It is optimal to choose the first supplier, using two size-4 boxes and one size-8 box.\nThe total waste is (4-2) + (4-3) + (8-5) = 6.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** packages = \\[2,3,5\\], boxes = \\[\\[1,4\\],\\[2,3\\],\\[3,4\\]\\]\n**Output:** -1\n**Explanation:** There is no box that the package of size 5 can fit in.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** packages = \\[3,5,8,10,11,12\\], boxes = \\[\\[12\\],\\[11,9\\],\\[10,5,14\\]\\]\n**Output:** 9\n**Explanation:** It is optimal to choose the third supplier, using two size-5 boxes, two size-10 boxes, and two size-14 boxes.\nThe total waste is (5-3) + (5-5) + (10-8) + (10-10) + (14-11) + (14-12) = 9.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == packages.length`\n*   `m == boxes.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 105`\n*   `1 <= m <= 105`\n*   `1 <= packages[i] <= 105`\n*   `1 <= boxes[j].length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= boxes[j][k] <= 105`\n*   `sum(boxes[j].length) <= 105`\n*   The elements in `boxes[j]` are **distinct**.",
