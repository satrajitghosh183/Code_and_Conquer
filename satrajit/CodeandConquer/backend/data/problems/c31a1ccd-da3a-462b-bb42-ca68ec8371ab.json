  "description": "You are given a string `s` that contains digits `0-9`, addition symbols `'+'`, and multiplication symbols `'*'` **only**, representing a **valid** math expression of **single digit numbers** (e.g., `3+5*2`). This expression was given to `n` elementary school students. The students were instructed to get the answer of the expression by following this **order of operations**:\n\n1.  Compute **multiplication**, reading from **left to right**; Then,\n2.  Compute **addition**, reading from **left to right**.\n\nYou are given an integer array `answers` of length `n`, which are the submitted answers of the students in no particular order. You are asked to grade the `answers`, by following these **rules**:\n\n*   If an answer **equals** the correct answer of the expression, this student will be rewarded `5` points;\n*   Otherwise, if the answer **could be interpreted** as if the student applied the operators **in the wrong order** but had **correct arithmetic**, this student will be rewarded `2` points;\n*   Otherwise, this student will be rewarded `0` points.\n\nReturn _the sum of the points of the students_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"7+3\\*1\\*2 \", answers = \\[20,13,42\\]\n**Output:** 7\n**Explanation:** As illustrated above, the correct answer of the expression is 13, therefore one student is rewarded 5 points: \\[20,**13**,42\\]\nA student might have applied the operators in this wrong order: ((7+3)\\*1)\\*2 = 20. Therefore one student is rewarded 2 points: \\[**20**,13,42\\]\nThe points for the students are: \\[2,5,0\\]. The sum of the points is 2+5+0=7.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"3+5\\*2 \", answers = \\[13,0,10,13,13,16,16\\]\n**Output:** 19\n**Explanation:** The correct answer of the expression is 13, therefore three students are rewarded 5 points each: \\[**13**,0,10,**13**,**13**,16,16\\]\nA student might have applied the operators in this wrong order: ((3+5)\\*2 = 16. Therefore two students are rewarded 2 points: \\[13,0,10,13,13,**16**,**16**\\]\nThe points for the students are: \\[5,0,0,5,5,2,2\\]. The sum of the points is 5+0+0+5+5+2+2=19.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"6+0\\*1 \", answers = \\[12,9,6,4,8,6\\]\n**Output:** 10\n**Explanation:** The correct answer of the expression is 6.\nIf a student had incorrectly done (6+0)\\*1, the answer would also be 6.\nBy the rules of grading, the students will still be rewarded 5 points (as they got the correct answer), not 2 points.\nThe points for the students are: \\[0,0,5,0,0,5\\]. The sum of the points is 10.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `3 <= s.length <= 31`\n*   `s` represents a valid expression that contains only digits `0-9`, `'+'`, and `'*'` only.\n*   All the integer operands in the expression are in the **inclusive** range `[0, 9]`.\n*   `1 <=` The count of all operators (`'+'` and `'*'`) in the math expression `<= 15`\n*   Test data are generated such that the correct answer of the expression is in the range of `[0, 1000]`.\n*   `n == answers.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 104`\n*   `0 <= answers[i] <= 1000`",
