  "description": "Two strings `word1` and `word2` are considered **almost equivalent** if the differences between the frequencies of each letter from `'a'` to `'z'` between `word1` and `word2` is **at most** `3`.\n\nGiven two strings `word1` and `word2`, each of length `n`, return `true` _if_ `word1` _and_ `word2` _are **almost equivalent**, or_ `false` _otherwise_.\n\nThe **frequency** of a letter `x` is the number of times it occurs in the string.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** word1 =  \"aaaa \", word2 =  \"bccb \"\n**Output:** false\n**Explanation:** There are 4 'a's in  \"aaaa \" but 0 'a's in  \"bccb \".\nThe difference is 4, which is more than the allowed 3.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** word1 =  \"abcdeef \", word2 =  \"abaaacc \"\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:** The differences between the frequencies of each letter in word1 and word2 are at most 3:\n- 'a' appears 1 time in word1 and 4 times in word2. The difference is 3.\n- 'b' appears 1 time in word1 and 1 time in word2. The difference is 0.\n- 'c' appears 1 time in word1 and 2 times in word2. The difference is 1.\n- 'd' appears 1 time in word1 and 0 times in word2. The difference is 1.\n- 'e' appears 2 times in word1 and 0 times in word2. The difference is 2.\n- 'f' appears 1 time in word1 and 0 times in word2. The difference is 1.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** word1 =  \"cccddabba \", word2 =  \"babababab \"\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:** The differences between the frequencies of each letter in word1 and word2 are at most 3:\n- 'a' appears 2 times in word1 and 4 times in word2. The difference is 2.\n- 'b' appears 2 times in word1 and 5 times in word2. The difference is 3.\n- 'c' appears 3 times in word1 and 0 times in word2. The difference is 3.\n- 'd' appears 2 times in word1 and 0 times in word2. The difference is 2.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == word1.length == word2.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 100`\n*   `word1` and `word2` consist only of lowercase English letters.",
