  "description": "You are given two strings `a` and `b` that consist of lowercase letters. In one operation, you can change any character in `a` or `b` to **any lowercase letter**.\n\nYour goal is to satisfy **one** of the following three conditions:\n\n*   **Every** letter in `a` is **strictly less** than **every** letter in `b` in the alphabet.\n*   **Every** letter in `b` is **strictly less** than **every** letter in `a` in the alphabet.\n*   **Both** `a` and `b` consist of **only one** distinct letter.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** number of operations needed to achieve your goal._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** a =  \"aba \", b =  \"caa \"\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** Consider the best way to make each condition true:\n1) Change b to  \"ccc \" in 2 operations, then every letter in a is less than every letter in b.\n2) Change a to  \"bbb \" and b to  \"aaa \" in 3 operations, then every letter in b is less than every letter in a.\n3) Change a to  \"aaa \" and b to  \"aaa \" in 2 operations, then a and b consist of one distinct letter.\nThe best way was done in 2 operations (either condition 1 or condition 3).\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** a =  \"dabadd \", b =  \"cda \"\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** The best way is to make condition 1 true by changing b to  \"eee \".\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 105`\n*   `a` and `b` consist only of lowercase letters.",
