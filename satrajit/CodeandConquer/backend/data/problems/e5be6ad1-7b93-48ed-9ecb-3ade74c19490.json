  "description": "A perfectly straight street is represented by a number line. The street has building(s) on it and is represented by a 2D integer array `buildings`, where `buildings[i] = [starti, endi, heighti]`. This means that there is a building with `heighti` in the **half-closed segment** `[starti, endi)`.\n\nYou want to **describe** the heights of the buildings on the street with the **minimum** number of non-overlapping **segments**. The street can be represented by the 2D integer array `street` where `street[j] = [leftj, rightj, averagej]` describes a **half-closed segment** `[leftj, rightj)` of the road where the **average** heights of the buildings in the **segment** is `averagej`.\n\n*   For example, if `buildings = [[1,5,2],[3,10,4]],` the street could be represented by `street = [[1,3,2],[3,5,3],[5,10,4]]` because:\n    *   From 1 to 3, there is only the first building with an average height of `2 / 1 = 2`.\n    *   From 3 to 5, both the first and the second building are there with an average height of `(2+4) / 2 = 3`.\n    *   From 5 to 10, there is only the second building with an average height of `4 / 1 = 4`.\n\nGiven `buildings`, return _the 2D integer array_ `street` _as described above (**excluding** any areas of the street where there are no buldings). You may return the array in **any order**_.\n\nThe **average** of `n` elements is the **sum** of the `n` elements divided (**integer division**) by `n`.\n\nA **half-closed segment** `[a, b)` is the section of the number line between points `a` and `b` **including** point `a` and **not including** point `b`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** buildings = \\[\\[1,4,2\\],\\[3,9,4\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[\\[1,3,2\\],\\[3,4,3\\],\\[4,9,4\\]\\]\n**Explanation:**\nFrom 1 to 3, there is only the first building with an average height of 2 / 1 = 2.\nFrom 3 to 4, both the first and the second building are there with an average height of (2+4) / 2 = 3.\nFrom 4 to 9, there is only the second building with an average height of 4 / 1 = 4.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** buildings = \\[\\[1,3,2\\],\\[2,5,3\\],\\[2,8,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[\\[1,3,2\\],\\[3,8,3\\]\\]\n**Explanation:**\nFrom 1 to 2, there is only the first building with an average height of 2 / 1 = 2.\nFrom 2 to 3, all three buildings are there with an average height of (2+3+3) / 3 = 2.\nFrom 3 to 5, both the second and the third building are there with an average height of (3+3) / 2 = 3.\nFrom 5 to 8, there is only the last building with an average height of 3 / 1 = 3.\nThe average height from 1 to 3 is the same so we can group them into one segment.\nThe average height from 3 to 8 is the same so we can group them into one segment.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** buildings = \\[\\[1,2,1\\],\\[5,6,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[\\[1,2,1\\],\\[5,6,1\\]\\]\n**Explanation:**\nFrom 1 to 2, there is only the first building with an average height of 1 / 1 = 1.\nFrom 2 to 5, there are no buildings, so it is not included in the output.\nFrom 5 to 6, there is only the second building with an average height of 1 / 1 = 1.\nWe cannot group the segments together because an empty space with no buildings seperates the segments.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= buildings.length <= 105`\n*   `buildings[i].length == 3`\n*   `0 <= starti < endi <= 108`\n*   `1 <= heighti <= 105`",
