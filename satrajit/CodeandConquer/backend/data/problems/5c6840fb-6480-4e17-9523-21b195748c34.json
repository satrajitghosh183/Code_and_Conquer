  "description": "You want to build `n` new buildings in a city. The new buildings will be built in a line and are labeled from `1` to `n`.\n\nHowever, there are city restrictions on the heights of the new buildings:\n\n*   The height of each building must be a non-negative integer.\n*   The height of the first building **must** be `0`.\n*   The height difference between any two adjacent buildings **cannot exceed** `1`.\n\nAdditionally, there are city restrictions on the maximum height of specific buildings. These restrictions are given as a 2D integer array `restrictions` where `restrictions[i] = [idi, maxHeighti]` indicates that building `idi` must have a height **less than or equal to** `maxHeighti`.\n\nIt is guaranteed that each building will appear **at most once** in `restrictions`, and building `1` will **not** be in `restrictions`.\n\nReturn _the **maximum possible height** of the **tallest** building_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 5, restrictions = \\[\\[2,1\\],\\[4,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** The green area in the image indicates the maximum allowed height for each building.\nWe can build the buildings with heights \\[0,1,2,1,2\\], and the tallest building has a height of 2.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 6, restrictions = \\[\\]\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** The green area in the image indicates the maximum allowed height for each building.\nWe can build the buildings with heights \\[0,1,2,3,4,5\\], and the tallest building has a height of 5.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** n = 10, restrictions = \\[\\[5,3\\],\\[2,5\\],\\[7,4\\],\\[10,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** The green area in the image indicates the maximum allowed height for each building.\nWe can build the buildings with heights \\[0,1,2,3,3,4,4,5,4,3\\], and the tallest building has a height of 5.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= n <= 109`\n*   `0 <= restrictions.length <= min(n - 1, 105)`\n*   `2 <= idi <= n`\n*   `idi` is **unique**.\n*   `0 <= maxHeighti <= 109`",
