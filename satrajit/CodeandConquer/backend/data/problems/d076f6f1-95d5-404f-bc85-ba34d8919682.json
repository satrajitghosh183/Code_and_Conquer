  "title": "Maximum Cost of Trip With K Highways",
  "slug": "maximum-cost-of-trip-with-k-highways",
  "description": "A series of highways connect `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a 2D integer array `highways` where `highways[i] = [city1i, city2i, tolli]` indicates that there is a highway that connects `city1i` and `city2i`, allowing a car to go from `city1i` to `city2i` and **vice versa** for a cost of `tolli`.\n\nYou are also given an integer `k`. You are going on a trip that crosses **exactly** `k` highways. You may start at any city, but you may only visit each city **at most** once during your trip.\n\nReturn _the **maximum** cost of your trip. If there is no trip that meets the requirements, return_ `-1`_._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 5, highways = \\[\\[0,1,4\\],\\[2,1,3\\],\\[1,4,11\\],\\[3,2,3\\],\\[3,4,2\\]\\], k = 3\n**Output:** 17\n**Explanation:**\nOne possible trip is to go from 0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3. The cost of this trip is 4 + 11 + 2 = 17.\nAnother possible trip is to go from 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3. The cost of this trip is 11 + 3 + 3 = 17.\nIt can be proven that 17 is the maximum possible cost of any valid trip.\n\nNote that the trip 4 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 is not allowed because you visit the city 1 twice.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 4, highways = \\[\\[0,1,3\\],\\[2,3,2\\]\\], k = 2\n**Output:** -1\n**Explanation:** There are no valid trips of length 2, so return -1.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= n <= 15`\n*   `1 <= highways.length <= 50`\n*   `highways[i].length == 3`\n*   `0 <= city1i, city2i <= n - 1`\n*   `city1i != city2i`\n*   `0 <= tolli <= 100`\n*   `1 <= k <= 50`\n*   There are no duplicate highways.",
