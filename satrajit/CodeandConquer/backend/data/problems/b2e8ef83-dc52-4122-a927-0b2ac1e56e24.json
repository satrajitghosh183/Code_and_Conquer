  "slug": "maximum-product-of-the-length-of-two-palindromic-subsequences",
  "description": "Given a string `s`, find two **disjoint palindromic subsequences** of `s` such that the **product** of their lengths is **maximized**. The two subsequences are **disjoint** if they do not both pick a character at the same index.\n\nReturn _the **maximum** possible **product** of the lengths of the two palindromic subsequences_.\n\nA **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. A string is **palindromic** if it reads the same forward and backward.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"leetcodecom \"\n**Output:** 9\n**Explanation**: An optimal solution is to choose  \"ete \" for the 1st subsequence and  \"cdc \" for the 2nd subsequence.\nThe product of their lengths is: 3 \\* 3 = 9.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"bb \"\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation**: An optimal solution is to choose  \"b \" (the first character) for the 1st subsequence and  \"b \" (the second character) for the 2nd subsequence.\nThe product of their lengths is: 1 \\* 1 = 1.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"accbcaxxcxx \"\n**Output:** 25\n**Explanation**: An optimal solution is to choose  \"accca \" for the 1st subsequence and  \"xxcxx \" for the 2nd subsequence.\nThe product of their lengths is: 5 \\* 5 = 25.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= s.length <= 12`\n*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.",
