  "description": "You are given an array of integers `nums`. You are also given an integer `original` which is the first number that needs to be searched for in `nums`.\n\nYou then do the following steps:\n\n1.  If `original` is found in `nums`, **multiply** it by two (i.e., set `original = 2 * original`).\n2.  Otherwise, **stop** the process.\n3.  **Repeat** this process with the new number as long as you keep finding the number.\n\nReturn _the **final** value of_ `original`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[5,3,6,1,12\\], original = 3\n**Output:** 24\n**Explanation:** \n- 3 is found in nums. 3 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 6.\n- 6 is found in nums. 6 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 12.\n- 12 is found in nums. 12 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 24.\n- 24 is not found in nums. Thus, 24 is returned.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[2,7,9\\], original = 4\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:**\n- 4 is not found in nums. Thus, 4 is returned.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`\n*   `1 <= nums[i], original <= 1000`",
