  "description": "Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the number of nodes where the value of the node is equal to the **average** of the values in its **subtree**_.\n\n**Note:**\n\n*   The **average** of `n` elements is the **sum** of the `n` elements divided by `n` and **rounded down** to the nearest integer.\n*   A **subtree** of `root` is a tree consisting of `root` and all of its descendants.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** root = \\[4,8,5,0,1,null,6\\]\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** \nFor the node with value 4: The average of its subtree is (4 + 8 + 5 + 0 + 1 + 6) / 6 = 24 / 6 = 4.\nFor the node with value 5: The average of its subtree is (5 + 6) / 2 = 11 / 2 = 5.\nFor the node with value 0: The average of its subtree is 0 / 1 = 0.\nFor the node with value 1: The average of its subtree is 1 / 1 = 1.\nFor the node with value 6: The average of its subtree is 6 / 1 = 6.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** root = \\[1\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** For the node with value 1: The average of its subtree is 1 / 1 = 1.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.\n*   `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`",
