  "description": "You are given two strings `s` and `t` consisting of only lowercase English letters.\n\nReturn _the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of_ `s` _so that_ `t` _becomes a **subsequence** of_ `s`.\n\nA **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"coaching \", t =  \"coding \"\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** Append the characters  \"ding \" to the end of s so that s =  \"coachingding \".\nNow, t is a subsequence of s ( \"**co**aching**ding** \").\nIt can be shown that appending any 3 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"abcde \", t =  \"a \"\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** t is already a subsequence of s ( \"**a**bcde \").\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"z \", t =  \"abcde \"\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** Append the characters  \"abcde \" to the end of s so that s =  \"zabcde \".\nNow, t is a subsequence of s ( \"z**abcde** \").\nIt can be shown that appending any 4 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 105`\n*   `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.",
