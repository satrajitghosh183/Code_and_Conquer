  "description": "Alice manages a company and has rented some floors of a building as office space. Alice has decided some of these floors should be **special floors**, used for relaxation only.\n\nYou are given two integers `bottom` and `top`, which denote that Alice has rented all the floors from `bottom` to `top` (**inclusive**). You are also given the integer array `special`, where `special[i]` denotes a special floor that Alice has designated for relaxation.\n\nReturn _the **maximum** number of consecutive floors without a special floor_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** bottom = 2, top = 9, special = \\[4,6\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** The following are the ranges (inclusive) of consecutive floors without a special floor:\n- (2, 3) with a total amount of 2 floors.\n- (5, 5) with a total amount of 1 floor.\n- (7, 9) with a total amount of 3 floors.\nTherefore, we return the maximum number which is 3 floors.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** bottom = 6, top = 8, special = \\[7,6,8\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** Every floor rented is a special floor, so we return 0.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= special.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= bottom <= special[i] <= top <= 109`\n*   All the values of `special` are **unique**.",
