  "description": "There is a regular convex polygon with `n` vertices. The vertices are labeled from `0` to `n - 1` in a clockwise direction, and each vertex has **exactly one monkey**. The following figure shows a convex polygon of `6` vertices.\n\nEach monkey moves simultaneously to a neighboring vertex. A neighboring vertex for a vertex `i` can be:\n\n*   the vertex `(i + 1) % n` in the clockwise direction, or\n*   the vertex `(i - 1 + n) % n` in the counter-clockwise direction.\n\nA **collision** happens if at least two monkeys reside on the same vertex after the movement or intersect on an edge.\n\nReturn _the number of ways the monkeys can move so that at least **one collision**_ _happens_. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.\n\n**Note** that each monkey can only move once.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 3\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:** There are 8 total possible movements.\nTwo ways such that they collide at some point are:\n- Monkey 1 moves in a clockwise direction; monkey 2 moves in an anticlockwise direction; monkey 3 moves in a clockwise direction. Monkeys 1 and 2 collide.\n- Monkey 1 moves in an anticlockwise direction; monkey 2 moves in an anticlockwise direction; monkey 3 moves in a clockwise direction. Monkeys 1 and 3 collide.\nIt can be shown 6 total movements result in a collision.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 4\n**Output:** 14\n**Explanation:** It can be shown that there are 14 ways for the monkeys to collide.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `3 <= n <= 109`",
