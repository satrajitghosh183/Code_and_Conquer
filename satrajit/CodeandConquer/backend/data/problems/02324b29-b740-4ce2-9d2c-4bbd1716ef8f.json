  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** string array `words`, where `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.\n\nIn one operation, select any index `i` such that `0 < i < words.length` and `words[i - 1]` and `words[i]` are **anagrams**, and **delete** `words[i]` from `words`. Keep performing this operation as long as you can select an index that satisfies the conditions.\n\nReturn `words` _after performing all operations_. It can be shown that selecting the indices for each operation in **any** arbitrary order will lead to the same result.\n\nAn **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase using all the original letters exactly once. For example, `\"dacb \"` is an anagram of `\"abdc \"`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** words = \\[ \"abba \", \"baba \", \"bbaa \", \"cd \", \"cd \"\\]\n**Output:** \\[ \"abba \", \"cd \"\\]\n**Explanation:**\nOne of the ways we can obtain the resultant array is by using the following operations:\n- Since words\\[2\\] =  \"bbaa \" and words\\[1\\] =  \"baba \" are anagrams, we choose index 2 and delete words\\[2\\].\n  Now words = \\[ \"abba \", \"baba \", \"cd \", \"cd \"\\].\n- Since words\\[1\\] =  \"baba \" and words\\[0\\] =  \"abba \" are anagrams, we choose index 1 and delete words\\[1\\].\n  Now words = \\[ \"abba \", \"cd \", \"cd \"\\].\n- Since words\\[2\\] =  \"cd \" and words\\[1\\] =  \"cd \" are anagrams, we choose index 2 and delete words\\[2\\].\n  Now words = \\[ \"abba \", \"cd \"\\].\nWe can no longer perform any operations, so \\[ \"abba \", \"cd \"\\] is the final answer.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** words = \\[ \"a \", \"b \", \"c \", \"d \", \"e \"\\]\n**Output:** \\[ \"a \", \"b \", \"c \", \"d \", \"e \"\\]\n**Explanation:**\nNo two adjacent strings in words are anagrams of each other, so no operations are performed.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= words.length <= 100`\n*   `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`\n*   `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.",
