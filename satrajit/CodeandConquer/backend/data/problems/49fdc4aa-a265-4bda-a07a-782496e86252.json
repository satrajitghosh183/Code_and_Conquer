  "description": "You are given an integer `money` denoting the amount of money (in dollars) that you have and another integer `children` denoting the number of children that you must distribute the money to.\n\nYou have to distribute the money according to the following rules:\n\n*   All money must be distributed.\n*   Everyone must receive at least `1` dollar.\n*   Nobody receives `4` dollars.\n\nReturn _the **maximum** number of children who may receive **exactly**_ `8` _dollars if you distribute the money according to the aforementioned rules_. If there is no way to distribute the money, return `-1`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** money = 20, children = 3\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** \nThe maximum number of children with 8 dollars will be 1. One of the ways to distribute the money is:\n- 8 dollars to the first child.\n- 9 dollars to the second child. \n- 3 dollars to the third child.\nIt can be proven that no distribution exists such that number of children getting 8 dollars is greater than 1.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** money = 16, children = 2\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** Each child can be given 8 dollars.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= money <= 200`\n*   `2 <= children <= 30`",
