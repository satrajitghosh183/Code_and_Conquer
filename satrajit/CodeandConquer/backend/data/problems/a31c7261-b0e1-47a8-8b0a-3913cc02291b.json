  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** array of non-negative integers `nums`. For each integer in `nums`, you must find its respective **second greater** integer.\n\nThe **second greater** integer of `nums[i]` is `nums[j]` such that:\n\n*   `j > i`\n*   `nums[j] > nums[i]`\n*   There exists **exactly one** index `k` such that `nums[k] > nums[i]` and `i < k < j`.\n\nIf there is no such `nums[j]`, the second greater integer is considered to be `-1`.\n\n*   For example, in the array `[1, 2, 4, 3]`, the second greater integer of `1` is `4`, `2` is `3`, and that of `3` and `4` is `-1`.\n\nReturn _an integer array_ `answer`_, where_ `answer[i]` _is the second greater integer of_ `nums[i]`_._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[2,4,0,9,6\\]\n**Output:** \\[9,6,6,-1,-1\\]\n**Explanation:**\n0th index: 4 is the first integer greater than 2, and 9 is the second integer greater than 2, to the right of 2.\n1st index: 9 is the first, and 6 is the second integer greater than 4, to the right of 4.\n2nd index: 9 is the first, and 6 is the second integer greater than 0, to the right of 0.\n3rd index: There is no integer greater than 9 to its right, so the second greater integer is considered to be -1.\n4th index: There is no integer greater than 6 to its right, so the second greater integer is considered to be -1.\nThus, we return \\[9,6,6,-1,-1\\].\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[3,3\\]\n**Output:** \\[-1,-1\\]\n**Explanation:**\nWe return \\[-1,-1\\] since neither integer has any integer greater than it.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`\n*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 109`",
