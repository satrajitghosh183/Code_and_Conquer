  "description": "You are given the logs for users' actions on LeetCode, and an integer `k`. The logs are represented by a 2D integer array `logs` where each `logs[i] = [IDi, timei]` indicates that the user with `IDi` performed an action at the minute `timei`.\n\n**Multiple users** can perform actions simultaneously, and a single user can perform **multiple actions** in the same minute.\n\nThe **user active minutes (UAM)** for a given user is defined as the **number of unique minutes** in which the user performed an action on LeetCode. A minute can only be counted once, even if multiple actions occur during it.\n\nYou are to calculate a **1-indexed** array `answer` of size `k` such that, for each `j` (`1 <= j <= k`), `answer[j]` is the **number of users** whose **UAM** equals `j`.\n\nReturn _the array_ `answer` _as described above_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** logs = \\[\\[0,5\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[0,2\\],\\[0,5\\],\\[1,3\\]\\], k = 5\n**Output:** \\[0,2,0,0,0\\]\n**Explanation:**\nThe user with ID=0 performed actions at minutes 5, 2, and 5 again. Hence, they have a UAM of 2 (minute 5 is only counted once).\nThe user with ID=1 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.\nSince both users have a UAM of 2, answer\\[2\\] is 2, and the remaining answer\\[j\\] values are 0.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** logs = \\[\\[1,1\\],\\[2,2\\],\\[2,3\\]\\], k = 4\n**Output:** \\[1,1,0,0\\]\n**Explanation:**\nThe user with ID=1 performed a single action at minute 1. Hence, they have a UAM of 1.\nThe user with ID=2 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.\nThere is one user with a UAM of 1 and one with a UAM of 2.\nHence, answer\\[1\\] = 1, answer\\[2\\] = 1, and the remaining values are 0.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= logs.length <= 104`\n*   `0 <= IDi <= 109`\n*   `1 <= timei <= 105`\n*   `k` is in the range `[The maximum **UAM** for a user, 105]`.",
