  "description": "Alice and Bob take turns playing a game with **Alice starting first**.\n\nIn this game, there are `n` piles of stones. On each player's turn, the player should remove any **positive** number of stones from a non-empty pile **of his or her choice**. The first player who cannot make a move loses, and the other player wins.\n\nGiven an integer array `piles`, where `piles[i]` is the number of stones in the `ith` pile, return `true` _if Alice wins, or_ `false` _if Bob wins_.\n\nBoth Alice and Bob play **optimally**.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** piles = \\[1\\]\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:** There is only one possible scenario:\n- On the first turn, Alice removes one stone from the first pile. piles = \\[0\\].\n- On the second turn, there are no stones left for Bob to remove. Alice wins.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** piles = \\[1,1\\]\n**Output:** false\n**Explanation:** It can be proven that Bob will always win. One possible scenario is:\n- On the first turn, Alice removes one stone from the first pile. piles = \\[0,1\\].\n- On the second turn, Bob removes one stone from the second pile. piles = \\[0,0\\].\n- On the third turn, there are no stones left for Alice to remove. Bob wins.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** piles = \\[1,2,3\\]\n**Output:** false\n**Explanation:** It can be proven that Bob will always win. One possible scenario is:\n- On the first turn, Alice removes three stones from the third pile. piles = \\[1,2,0\\].\n- On the second turn, Bob removes one stone from the second pile. piles = \\[1,1,0\\].\n- On the third turn, Alice removes one stone from the first pile. piles = \\[0,1,0\\].\n- On the fourth turn, Bob removes one stone from the second pile. piles = \\[0,0,0\\].\n- On the fifth turn, there are no stones left for Alice to remove. Bob wins.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == piles.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 7`\n*   `1 <= piles[i] <= 7`\n\n**Follow-up:** Could you find a linear time solution? Although the linear time solution may be beyond the scope of an interview, it could be interesting to know.",
