  "description": "You are given two arrays of positive integers, `boxes` and `warehouse`, representing the heights of some boxes of unit width and the heights of `n` rooms in a warehouse respectively. The warehouse's rooms are labelled from `0` to `n - 1` from left to right where `warehouse[i]` (0-indexed) is the height of the `ith` room.\n\nBoxes are put into the warehouse by the following rules:\n\n*   Boxes cannot be stacked.\n*   You can rearrange the insertion order of the boxes.\n*   Boxes can only be pushed into the warehouse from left to right only.\n*   If the height of some room in the warehouse is less than the height of a box, then that box and all other boxes behind it will be stopped before that room.\n\nReturn _the maximum number of boxes you can put into the warehouse._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** boxes = \\[4,3,4,1\\], warehouse = \\[5,3,3,4,1\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** \n \nWe can first put the box of height 1 in room 4. Then we can put the box of height 3 in either of the 3 rooms 1, 2, or 3. Lastly, we can put one box of height 4 in room 0.\nThere is no way we can fit all 4 boxes in the warehouse.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** boxes = \\[1,2,2,3,4\\], warehouse = \\[3,4,1,2\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** \n \nNotice that it's not possible to put the box of height 4 into the warehouse since it cannot pass the first room of height 3.\nAlso, for the last two rooms, 2 and 3, only boxes of height 1 can fit.\nWe can fit 3 boxes maximum as shown above. The yellow box can also be put in room 2 instead.\nSwapping the orange and green boxes is also valid, or swapping one of them with the red box.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** boxes = \\[1,2,3\\], warehouse = \\[1,2,3,4\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** Since the first room in the warehouse is of height 1, we can only put boxes of height 1.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == warehouse.length`\n*   `1 <= boxes.length, warehouse.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= boxes[i], warehouse[i] <= 109`",
