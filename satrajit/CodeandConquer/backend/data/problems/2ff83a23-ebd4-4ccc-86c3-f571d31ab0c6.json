  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` of **distinct** integers. You want to rearrange the elements in the array such that every element in the rearranged array is **not** equal to the **average** of its neighbors.\n\nMore formally, the rearranged array should have the property such that for every `i` in the range `1 <= i < nums.length - 1`, `(nums[i-1] + nums[i+1]) / 2` is **not** equal to `nums[i]`.\n\nReturn _**any** rearrangement of_ `nums` _that meets the requirements_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[1,2,3,4,5\\]\n**Output:** \\[1,2,4,5,3\\]\n**Explanation:**\nWhen i=1, nums\\[i\\] = 2, and the average of its neighbors is (1+4) / 2 = 2.5.\nWhen i=2, nums\\[i\\] = 4, and the average of its neighbors is (2+5) / 2 = 3.5.\nWhen i=3, nums\\[i\\] = 5, and the average of its neighbors is (4+3) / 2 = 3.5.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[6,2,0,9,7\\]\n**Output:** \\[9,7,6,2,0\\]\n**Explanation:**\nWhen i=1, nums\\[i\\] = 7, and the average of its neighbors is (9+6) / 2 = 7.5.\nWhen i=2, nums\\[i\\] = 6, and the average of its neighbors is (7+2) / 2 = 4.5.\nWhen i=3, nums\\[i\\] = 2, and the average of its neighbors is (6+0) / 2 = 3.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `3 <= nums.length <= 105`\n*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 105`",
