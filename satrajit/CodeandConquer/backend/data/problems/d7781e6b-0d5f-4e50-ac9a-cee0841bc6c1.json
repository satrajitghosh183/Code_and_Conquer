  "description": "There is a long and thin painting that can be represented by a number line. The painting was painted with multiple overlapping segments where each segment was painted with a **unique** color. You are given a 2D integer array `segments`, where `segments[i] = [starti, endi, colori]` represents the **half-closed segment** `[starti, endi)` with `colori` as the color.\n\nThe colors in the overlapping segments of the painting were **mixed** when it was painted. When two or more colors mix, they form a new color that can be represented as a **set** of mixed colors.\n\n*   For example, if colors `2`, `4`, and `6` are mixed, then the resulting mixed color is `{2,4,6}`.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, you should only output the **sum** of the elements in the set rather than the full set.\n\nYou want to **describe** the painting with the **minimum** number of non-overlapping **half-closed segments** of these mixed colors. These segments can be represented by the 2D array `painting` where `painting[j] = [leftj, rightj, mixj]` describes a **half-closed segment** `[leftj, rightj)` with the mixed color **sum** of `mixj`.\n\n*   For example, the painting created with `segments = [[1,4,5],[1,7,7]]` can be described by `painting = [[1,4,12],[4,7,7]]` because:\n    *   `[1,4)` is colored `{5,7}` (with a sum of `12`) from both the first and second segments.\n    *   `[4,7)` is colored `{7}` from only the second segment.\n\nReturn _the 2D array_ `painting` _describing the finished painting (excluding any parts that are **not** painted). You may return the segments in **any order**_.\n\nA **half-closed segment** `[a, b)` is the section of the number line between points `a` and `b` **including** point `a` and **not including** point `b`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** segments = \\[\\[1,4,5\\],\\[4,7,7\\],\\[1,7,9\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[\\[1,4,14\\],\\[4,7,16\\]\\]\n**Explanation:** The painting can be described as follows:\n- \\[1,4) is colored {5,9} (with a sum of 14) from the first and third segments.\n- \\[4,7) is colored {7,9} (with a sum of 16) from the second and third segments.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** segments = \\[\\[1,7,9\\],\\[6,8,15\\],\\[8,10,7\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[\\[1,6,9\\],\\[6,7,24\\],\\[7,8,15\\],\\[8,10,7\\]\\]\n**Explanation:** The painting can be described as follows:\n- \\[1,6) is colored 9 from the first segment.\n- \\[6,7) is colored {9,15} (with a sum of 24) from the first and second segments.\n- \\[7,8) is colored 15 from the second segment.\n- \\[8,10) is colored 7 from the third segment.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** segments = \\[\\[1,4,5\\],\\[1,4,7\\],\\[4,7,1\\],\\[4,7,11\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[\\[1,4,12\\],\\[4,7,12\\]\\]\n**Explanation:** The painting can be described as follows:\n- \\[1,4) is colored {5,7} (with a sum of 12) from the first and second segments.\n- \\[4,7) is colored {1,11} (with a sum of 12) from the third and fourth segments.\nNote that returning a single segment \\[1,7) is incorrect because the mixed color sets are different.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= segments.length <= 2 * 104`\n*   `segments[i].length == 3`\n*   `1 <= starti < endi <= 105`\n*   `1 <= colori <= 109`\n*   Each `colori` is distinct.",
