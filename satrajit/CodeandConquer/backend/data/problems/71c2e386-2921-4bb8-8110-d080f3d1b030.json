  "description": "There are `n` rooms you need to visit, labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. Each day is labeled, starting from `0`. You will go in and visit one room a day.\n\nInitially on day `0`, you visit room `0`. The **order** you visit the rooms for the coming days is determined by the following **rules** and a given **0-indexed** array `nextVisit` of length `n`:\n\n*   Assuming that on a day, you visit room `i`,\n*   if you have been in room `i` an **odd** number of times (**including** the current visit), on the **next** day you will visit a room with a **lower or equal room number** specified by `nextVisit[i]` where `0 <= nextVisit[i] <= i`;\n*   if you have been in room `i` an **even** number of times (**including** the current visit), on the **next** day you will visit room `(i + 1) mod n`.\n\nReturn _the label of the **first** day where you have been in **all** the rooms_. It can be shown that such a day exists. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nextVisit = \\[0,0\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:**\n- On day 0, you visit room 0. The total times you have been in room 0 is 1, which is odd.\n  On the next day you will visit room nextVisit\\[0\\] = 0\n- On day 1, you visit room 0, The total times you have been in room 0 is 2, which is even.\n  On the next day you will visit room (0 + 1) mod 2 = 1\n- On day 2, you visit room 1. This is the first day where you have been in all the rooms.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nextVisit = \\[0,0,2\\]\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:**\nYour room visiting order for each day is: \\[0,0,1,0,0,1,2,...\\].\nDay 6 is the first day where you have been in all the rooms.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** nextVisit = \\[0,1,2,0\\]\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:**\nYour room visiting order for each day is: \\[0,0,1,1,2,2,3,...\\].\nDay 6 is the first day where you have been in all the rooms.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == nextVisit.length`\n*   `2 <= n <= 105`\n*   `0 <= nextVisit[i] <= i`",
