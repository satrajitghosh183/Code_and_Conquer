  "description": "A maze consists of `n` rooms numbered from `1` to `n`, and some rooms are connected by corridors. You are given a 2D integer array `corridors` where `corridors[i] = [room1i, room2i]` indicates that there is a corridor connecting `room1i` and `room2i`, allowing a person in the maze to go from `room1i` to `room2i` **and vice versa**.\n\nThe designer of the maze wants to know how confusing the maze is. The **confusion** **score** of the maze is the number of different cycles of **length 3**.\n\n*   For example, `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1` is a cycle of length 3, but `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4` and `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1` are not.\n\nTwo cycles are considered to be **different** if one or more of the rooms visited in the first cycle is **not** in the second cycle.\n\nReturn _the_ _**confusion** **score** of the maze._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 5, corridors = \\[\\[1,2\\],\\[5,2\\],\\[4,1\\],\\[2,4\\],\\[3,1\\],\\[3,4\\]\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:**\nOne cycle of length 3 is 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4, denoted in red.\nNote that this is the same cycle as 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3 or 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 because the rooms are the same.\nAnother cycle of length 3 is 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1, denoted in blue.\nThus, there are two different cycles of length 3.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 4, corridors = \\[\\[1,2\\],\\[3,4\\]\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:**\nThere are no cycles of length 3.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= n <= 1000`\n*   `1 <= corridors.length <= 5 * 104`\n*   `corridors[i].length == 2`\n*   `1 <= room1i, room2i <= n`\n*   `room1i != room2i`\n*   There are no duplicate corridors.",
