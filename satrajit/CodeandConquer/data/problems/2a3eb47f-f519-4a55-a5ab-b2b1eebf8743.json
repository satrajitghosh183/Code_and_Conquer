  "description": "You are given an integer `mass`, which represents the original mass of a planet. You are further given an integer array `asteroids`, where `asteroids[i]` is the mass of the `ith` asteroid.\n\nYou can arrange for the planet to collide with the asteroids in **any arbitrary order**. If the mass of the planet is **greater than or equal to** the mass of the asteroid, the asteroid is **destroyed** and the planet **gains** the mass of the asteroid. Otherwise, the planet is destroyed.\n\nReturn `true` _if **all** asteroids can be destroyed. Otherwise, return_ `false`_._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** mass = 10, asteroids = \\[3,9,19,5,21\\]\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:** One way to order the asteroids is \\[9,19,5,3,21\\]:\n- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 9. New planet mass: 10 + 9 = 19\n- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 19. New planet mass: 19 + 19 = 38\n- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 5. New planet mass: 38 + 5 = 43\n- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 3. New planet mass: 43 + 3 = 46\n- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 21. New planet mass: 46 + 21 = 67\nAll asteroids are destroyed.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** mass = 5, asteroids = \\[4,9,23,4\\]\n**Output:** false\n**Explanation:** \nThe planet cannot ever gain enough mass to destroy the asteroid with a mass of 23.\nAfter the planet destroys the other asteroids, it will have a mass of 5 + 4 + 9 + 4 = 22.\nThis is less than 23, so a collision would not destroy the last asteroid.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= mass <= 105`\n*   `1 <= asteroids.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= asteroids[i] <= 105`",
