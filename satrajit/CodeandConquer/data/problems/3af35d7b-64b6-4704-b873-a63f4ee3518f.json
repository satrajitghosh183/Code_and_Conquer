  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `brackets` where `brackets[i] = [upperi, percenti]` means that the `ith` tax bracket has an upper bound of `upperi` and is taxed at a rate of `percenti`. The brackets are **sorted** by upper bound (i.e. `upperi-1 < upperi` for `0 < i < brackets.length`).\n\nTax is calculated as follows:\n\n*   The first `upper0` dollars earned are taxed at a rate of `percent0`.\n*   The next `upper1 - upper0` dollars earned are taxed at a rate of `percent1`.\n*   The next `upper2 - upper1` dollars earned are taxed at a rate of `percent2`.\n*   And so on.\n\nYou are given an integer `income` representing the amount of money you earned. Return _the amount of money that you have to pay in taxes._ Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** brackets = \\[\\[3,50\\],\\[7,10\\],\\[12,25\\]\\], income = 10\n**Output:** 2.65000\n**Explanation:**\nBased on your income, you have 3 dollars in the 1st tax bracket, 4 dollars in the 2nd tax bracket, and 3 dollars in the 3rd tax bracket.\nThe tax rate for the three tax brackets is 50%, 10%, and 25%, respectively.\nIn total, you pay $3 \\* 50% + $4 \\* 10% + $3 \\* 25% = $2.65 in taxes.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** brackets = \\[\\[1,0\\],\\[4,25\\],\\[5,50\\]\\], income = 2\n**Output:** 0.25000\n**Explanation:**\nBased on your income, you have 1 dollar in the 1st tax bracket and 1 dollar in the 2nd tax bracket.\nThe tax rate for the two tax brackets is 0% and 25%, respectively.\nIn total, you pay $1 \\* 0% + $1 \\* 25% = $0.25 in taxes.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** brackets = \\[\\[2,50\\]\\], income = 0\n**Output:** 0.00000\n**Explanation:**\nYou have no income to tax, so you have to pay a total of $0 in taxes.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= brackets.length <= 100`\n*   `1 <= upperi <= 1000`\n*   `0 <= percenti <= 100`\n*   `0 <= income <= 1000`\n*   `upperi` is sorted in ascending order.\n*   All the values of `upperi` are **unique**.\n*   The upper bound of the last tax bracket is greater than or equal to `income`.",
