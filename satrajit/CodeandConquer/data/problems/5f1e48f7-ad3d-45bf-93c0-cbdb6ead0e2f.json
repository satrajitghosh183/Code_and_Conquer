  "title": "Words Within Two Edits of Dictionary",
  "slug": "words-within-two-edits-of-dictionary",
  "description": "You are given two string arrays, `queries` and `dictionary`. All words in each array comprise of lowercase English letters and have the same length.\n\nIn one **edit** you can take a word from `queries`, and change any letter in it to any other letter. Find all words from `queries` that, after a **maximum** of two edits, equal some word from `dictionary`.\n\nReturn _a list of all words from_ `queries`_,_ _that match with some word from_ `dictionary` _after a maximum of **two edits**_. Return the words in the **same order** they appear in `queries`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** queries = \\[ \"word \", \"note \", \"ants \", \"wood \"\\], dictionary = \\[ \"wood \", \"joke \", \"moat \"\\]\n**Output:** \\[ \"word \", \"note \", \"wood \"\\]\n**Explanation:**\n- Changing the 'r' in  \"word \" to 'o' allows it to equal the dictionary word  \"wood \".\n- Changing the 'n' to 'j' and the 't' to 'k' in  \"note \" changes it to  \"joke \".\n- It would take more than 2 edits for  \"ants \" to equal a dictionary word.\n-  \"wood \" can remain unchanged (0 edits) and match the corresponding dictionary word.\nThus, we return \\[ \"word \", \"note \", \"wood \"\\].\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** queries = \\[ \"yes \"\\], dictionary = \\[ \"not \"\\]\n**Output:** \\[\\]\n**Explanation:**\nApplying any two edits to  \"yes \" cannot make it equal to  \"not \". Thus, we return an empty array.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= queries.length, dictionary.length <= 100`\n*   `n == queries[i].length == dictionary[j].length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 100`\n*   All `queries[i]` and `dictionary[j]` are composed of lowercase English letters.",
