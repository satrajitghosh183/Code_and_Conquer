  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `books` of length `n` where `books[i]` denotes the number of books on the `ith` shelf of a bookshelf.\n\nYou are going to take books from a **contiguous** section of the bookshelf spanning from `l` to `r` where `0 <= l <= r < n`. For each index `i` in the range `l <= i < r`, you must take **strictly fewer** books from shelf `i` than shelf `i + 1`.\n\nReturn _the **maximum** number of books you can take from the bookshelf._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** books = \\[8,5,2,7,9\\]\n**Output:** 19\n**Explanation:**\n- Take 1 book from shelf 1.\n- Take 2 books from shelf 2.\n- Take 7 books from shelf 3.\n- Take 9 books from shelf 4.\nYou have taken 19 books, so return 19.\nIt can be proven that 19 is the maximum number of books you can take.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** books = \\[7,0,3,4,5\\]\n**Output:** 12\n**Explanation:**\n- Take 3 books from shelf 2.\n- Take 4 books from shelf 3.\n- Take 5 books from shelf 4.\nYou have taken 12 books so return 12.\nIt can be proven that 12 is the maximum number of books you can take.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** books = \\[8,2,3,7,3,4,0,1,4,3\\]\n**Output:** 13\n**Explanation:**\n- Take 1 book from shelf 0.\n- Take 2 books from shelf 1.\n- Take 3 books from shelf 2.\n- Take 7 books from shelf 3.\nYou have taken 13 books so return 13.\nIt can be proven that 13 is the maximum number of books you can take.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= books.length <= 105`\n*   `0 <= books[i] <= 105`",
