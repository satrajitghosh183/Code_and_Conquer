  "description": "You are given two non-negative integer arrays `price` and `tastiness`, both arrays have the same length `n`. You are also given two non-negative integers `maxAmount` and `maxCoupons`.\n\nFor every integer `i` in range `[0, n - 1]`:\n\n*   `price[i]` describes the price of `ith` fruit.\n*   `tastiness[i]` describes the tastiness of `ith` fruit.\n\nYou want to purchase some fruits such that total tastiness is maximized and the total price does not exceed `maxAmount`.\n\nAdditionally, you can use a coupon to purchase fruit for **half of its price** (rounded down to the closest integer). You can use at most `maxCoupons` of such coupons.\n\nReturn _the maximum total tastiness that can be purchased_.\n\n**Note that:**\n\n*   You can purchase each fruit at most once.\n*   You can use coupons on some fruit at most once.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** price = \\[10,20,20\\], tastiness = \\[5,8,8\\], maxAmount = 20, maxCoupons = 1\n**Output:** 13\n**Explanation:** It is possible to make total tastiness 13 in following way:\n- Buy first fruit without coupon, so that total price = 0 + 10 and total tastiness = 0 + 5.\n- Buy second fruit with coupon, so that total price = 10 + 10 and total tastiness = 5 + 8.\n- Do not buy third fruit, so that total price = 20 and total tastiness = 13.\nIt can be proven that 13 is the maximum total tastiness that can be obtained.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** price = \\[10,15,7\\], tastiness = \\[5,8,20\\], maxAmount = 10, maxCoupons = 2\n**Output:** 28\n**Explanation:** It is possible to make total tastiness 20 in following way:\n- Do not buy first fruit, so that total price = 0 and total tastiness = 0.\n- Buy second fruit with coupon, so that total price = 0 + 7 and total tastiness = 0 + 8.\n- Buy third fruit with coupon, so that total price = 7 + 3 and total tastiness = 8 + 20.\nIt can be proven that 28 is the maximum total tastiness that can be obtained.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == price.length == tastiness.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 100`\n*   `0 <= price[i], tastiness[i], maxAmount <= 1000`\n*   `0 <= maxCoupons <= 5`",
