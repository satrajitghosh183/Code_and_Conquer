  "description": "A perfectly straight street is represented by a number line. The street has street lamp(s) on it and is represented by a 2D integer array `lights`. Each `lights[i] = [positioni, rangei]` indicates that there is a street lamp at position `positioni` that lights up the area from `[positioni - rangei, positioni + rangei]` (**inclusive**).\n\nThe **brightness** of a position `p` is defined as the number of street lamp that light up the position `p`.\n\nGiven `lights`, return _the **brightest** position on the_ _street. If there are multiple brightest positions, return the **smallest** one._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** lights = \\[\\[-3,2\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[3,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** -1\n**Explanation:**\nThe first street lamp lights up the area from \\[(-3) - 2, (-3) + 2\\] = \\[-5, -1\\].\nThe second street lamp lights up the area from \\[1 - 2, 1 + 2\\] = \\[-1, 3\\].\nThe third street lamp lights up the area from \\[3 - 3, 3 + 3\\] = \\[0, 6\\].\n\nPosition -1 has a brightness of 2, illuminated by the first and second street light.\nPositions 0, 1, 2, and 3 have a brightness of 2, illuminated by the second and third street light.\nOut of all these positions, -1 is the smallest, so return it.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** lights = \\[\\[1,0\\],\\[0,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:**\nThe first street lamp lights up the area from \\[1 - 0, 1 + 0\\] = \\[1, 1\\].\nThe second street lamp lights up the area from \\[0 - 1, 0 + 1\\] = \\[-1, 1\\].\n\nPosition 1 has a brightness of 2, illuminated by the first and second street light.\nReturn 1 because it is the brightest position on the street.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** lights = \\[\\[1,2\\]\\]\n**Output:** -1\n**Explanation:**\nThe first street lamp lights up the area from \\[1 - 2, 1 + 2\\] = \\[-1, 3\\].\n\nPositions -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3 have a brightness of 1, illuminated by the first street light.\nOut of all these positions, -1 is the smallest, so return it.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= lights.length <= 105`\n*   `lights[i].length == 2`\n*   `-108 <= positioni <= 108`\n*   `0 <= rangei <= 108`",
