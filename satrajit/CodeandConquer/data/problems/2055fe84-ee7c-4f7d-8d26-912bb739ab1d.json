  "description": "Design a food rating system that can do the following:\n\n*   **Modify** the rating of a food item listed in the system.\n*   Return the highest-rated food item for a type of cuisine in the system.\n\nImplement the `FoodRatings` class:\n\n*   `FoodRatings(String[] foods, String[] cuisines, int[] ratings)` Initializes the system. The food items are described by `foods`, `cuisines` and `ratings`, all of which have a length of `n`.\n    *   `foods[i]` is the name of the `ith` food,\n    *   `cuisines[i]` is the type of cuisine of the `ith` food, and\n    *   `ratings[i]` is the initial rating of the `ith` food.\n*   `void changeRating(String food, int newRating)` Changes the rating of the food item with the name `food`.\n*   `String highestRated(String cuisine)` Returns the name of the food item that has the highest rating for the given type of `cuisine`. If there is a tie, return the item with the **lexicographically smaller** name.\n\nNote that a string `x` is lexicographically smaller than string `y` if `x` comes before `y` in dictionary order, that is, either `x` is a prefix of `y`, or if `i` is the first position such that `x[i] != y[i]`, then `x[i]` comes before `y[i]` in alphabetic order.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input**\n\\[ \"FoodRatings \",  \"highestRated \",  \"highestRated \",  \"changeRating \",  \"highestRated \",  \"changeRating \",  \"highestRated \"\\]\n\\[\\[\\[ \"kimchi \",  \"miso \",  \"sushi \",  \"moussaka \",  \"ramen \",  \"bulgogi \"\\], \\[ \"korean \",  \"japanese \",  \"japanese \",  \"greek \",  \"japanese \",  \"korean \"\\], \\[9, 12, 8, 15, 14, 7\\]\\], \\[ \"korean \"\\], \\[ \"japanese \"\\], \\[ \"sushi \", 16\\], \\[ \"japanese \"\\], \\[ \"ramen \", 16\\], \\[ \"japanese \"\\]\\]\n**Output**\n\\[null,  \"kimchi \",  \"ramen \", null,  \"sushi \", null,  \"ramen \"\\]\n\n**Explanation**\nFoodRatings foodRatings = new FoodRatings(\\[ \"kimchi \",  \"miso \",  \"sushi \",  \"moussaka \",  \"ramen \",  \"bulgogi \"\\], \\[ \"korean \",  \"japanese \",  \"japanese \",  \"greek \",  \"japanese \",  \"korean \"\\], \\[9, 12, 8, 15, 14, 7\\]);\nfoodRatings.highestRated( \"korean \"); // return  \"kimchi \"\n                                    //  \"kimchi \" is the highest rated korean food with a rating of 9.\nfoodRatings.highestRated( \"japanese \"); // return  \"ramen \"\n                                      //  \"ramen \" is the highest rated japanese food with a rating of 14.\nfoodRatings.changeRating( \"sushi \", 16); //  \"sushi \" now has a rating of 16.\nfoodRatings.highestRated( \"japanese \"); // return  \"sushi \"\n                                      //  \"sushi \" is the highest rated japanese food with a rating of 16.\nfoodRatings.changeRating( \"ramen \", 16); //  \"ramen \" now has a rating of 16.\nfoodRatings.highestRated( \"japanese \"); // return  \"ramen \"\n                                      // Both  \"sushi \" and  \"ramen \" have a rating of 16.\n                                      // However,  \"ramen \" is lexicographically smaller than  \"sushi \".\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`\n*   `n == foods.length == cuisines.length == ratings.length`\n*   `1 <= foods[i].length, cuisines[i].length <= 10`\n*   `foods[i]`, `cuisines[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.\n*   `1 <= ratings[i] <= 108`\n*   All the strings in `foods` are **distinct**.\n*   `food` will be the name of a food item in the system across all calls to `changeRating`.\n*   `cuisine` will be a type of cuisine of **at least one** food item in the system across all calls to `highestRated`.\n*   At most `2 * 104` calls **in total** will be made to `changeRating` and `highestRated`.",
