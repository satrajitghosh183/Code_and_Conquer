  "description": "There is an ATM machine that stores banknotes of `5` denominations: `20`, `50`, `100`, `200`, and `500` dollars. Initially the ATM is empty. The user can use the machine to deposit or withdraw any amount of money.\n\nWhen withdrawing, the machine prioritizes using banknotes of **larger** values.\n\n*   For example, if you want to withdraw `$300` and there are `2` `$50` banknotes, `1` `$100` banknote, and `1` `$200` banknote, then the machine will use the `$100` and `$200` banknotes.\n*   However, if you try to withdraw `$600` and there are `3` `$200` banknotes and `1` `$500` banknote, then the withdraw request will be rejected because the machine will first try to use the `$500` banknote and then be unable to use banknotes to complete the remaining `$100`. Note that the machine is **not** allowed to use the `$200` banknotes instead of the `$500` banknote.\n\nImplement the ATM class:\n\n*   `ATM()` Initializes the ATM object.\n*   `void deposit(int[] banknotesCount)` Deposits new banknotes in the order `$20`, `$50`, `$100`, `$200`, and `$500`.\n*   `int[] withdraw(int amount)` Returns an array of length `5` of the number of banknotes that will be handed to the user in the order `$20`, `$50`, `$100`, `$200`, and `$500`, and update the number of banknotes in the ATM after withdrawing. Returns `[-1]` if it is not possible (do **not** withdraw any banknotes in this case).\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input**\n\\[ \"ATM \",  \"deposit \",  \"withdraw \",  \"deposit \",  \"withdraw \",  \"withdraw \"\\]\n\\[\\[\\], \\[\\[0,0,1,2,1\\]\\], \\[600\\], \\[\\[0,1,0,1,1\\]\\], \\[600\\], \\[550\\]\\]\n**Output**\n\\[null, null, \\[0,0,1,0,1\\], null, \\[-1\\], \\[0,1,0,0,1\\]\\]\n\n**Explanation**\nATM atm = new ATM();\natm.deposit(\\[0,0,1,2,1\\]); // Deposits 1 $100 banknote, 2 $200 banknotes,\n                          // and 1 $500 banknote.\natm.withdraw(600);        // Returns \\[0,0,1,0,1\\]. The machine uses 1 $100 banknote\n                          // and 1 $500 banknote. The banknotes left over in the\n                          // machine are \\[0,0,0,2,0\\].\natm.deposit(\\[0,1,0,1,1\\]); // Deposits 1 $50, $200, and $500 banknote.\n                          // The banknotes in the machine are now \\[0,1,0,3,1\\].\natm.withdraw(600);        // Returns \\[-1\\]. The machine will try to use a $500 banknote\n                          // and then be unable to complete the remaining $100,\n                          // so the withdraw request will be rejected.\n                          // Since the request is rejected, the number of banknotes\n                          // in the machine is not modified.\natm.withdraw(550);        // Returns \\[0,1,0,0,1\\]. The machine uses 1 $50 banknote\n                          // and 1 $500 banknote.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `banknotesCount.length == 5`\n*   `0 <= banknotesCount[i] <= 109`\n*   `1 <= amount <= 109`\n*   At most `5000` calls **in total** will be made to `withdraw` and `deposit`.\n*   At least **one** call will be made to each function `withdraw` and `deposit`.",
