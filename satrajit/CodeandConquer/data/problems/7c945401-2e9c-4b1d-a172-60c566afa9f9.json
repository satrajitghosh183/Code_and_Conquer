  "description": "Given an array of strings `patterns` and a string `word`, return _the **number** of strings in_ `patterns` _that exist as a **substring** in_ `word`.\n\nA **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** patterns = \\[ \"a \", \"abc \", \"bc \", \"d \"\\], word =  \"abc \"\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:**\n-  \"a \" appears as a substring in  \"abc \".\n-  \"abc \" appears as a substring in  \"abc \".\n-  \"bc \" appears as a substring in  \"abc \".\n-  \"d \" does not appear as a substring in  \"abc \".\n3 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** patterns = \\[ \"a \", \"b \", \"c \"\\], word =  \"aaaaabbbbb \"\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:**\n-  \"a \" appears as a substring in  \"aaaaabbbbb \".\n-  \"b \" appears as a substring in  \"aaaaabbbbb \".\n-  \"c \" does not appear as a substring in  \"aaaaabbbbb \".\n2 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** patterns = \\[ \"a \", \"a \", \"a \"\\], word =  \"ab \"\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** Each of the patterns appears as a substring in word  \"ab \".\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= patterns.length <= 100`\n*   `1 <= patterns[i].length <= 100`\n*   `1 <= word.length <= 100`\n*   `patterns[i]` and `word` consist of lowercase English letters.",
