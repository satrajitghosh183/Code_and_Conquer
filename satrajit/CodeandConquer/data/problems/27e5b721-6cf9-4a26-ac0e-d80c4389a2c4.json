  "slug": "total-appeal-of-a-string",
  "description": "The **appeal** of a string is the number of **distinct** characters found in the string.\n\n*   For example, the appeal of `\"abbca \"` is `3` because it has `3` distinct characters: `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.\n\nGiven a string `s`, return _the **total appeal of all of its **substrings**.**_\n\nA **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"abbca \"\n**Output:** 28\n**Explanation:** The following are the substrings of  \"abbca \":\n- Substrings of length 1:  \"a \",  \"b \",  \"b \",  \"c \",  \"a \" have an appeal of 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1 respectively. The sum is 5.\n- Substrings of length 2:  \"ab \",  \"bb \",  \"bc \",  \"ca \" have an appeal of 2, 1, 2, and 2 respectively. The sum is 7.\n- Substrings of length 3:  \"abb \",  \"bbc \",  \"bca \" have an appeal of 2, 2, and 3 respectively. The sum is 7.\n- Substrings of length 4:  \"abbc \",  \"bbca \" have an appeal of 3 and 3 respectively. The sum is 6.\n- Substrings of length 5:  \"abbca \" has an appeal of 3. The sum is 3.\nThe total sum is 5 + 7 + 7 + 6 + 3 = 28.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"code \"\n**Output:** 20\n**Explanation:** The following are the substrings of  \"code \":\n- Substrings of length 1:  \"c \",  \"o \",  \"d \",  \"e \" have an appeal of 1, 1, 1, and 1 respectively. The sum is 4.\n- Substrings of length 2:  \"co \",  \"od \",  \"de \" have an appeal of 2, 2, and 2 respectively. The sum is 6.\n- Substrings of length 3:  \"cod \",  \"ode \" have an appeal of 3 and 3 respectively. The sum is 6.\n- Substrings of length 4:  \"code \" has an appeal of 4. The sum is 4.\nThe total sum is 4 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 20.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= s.length <= 105`\n*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters.",
