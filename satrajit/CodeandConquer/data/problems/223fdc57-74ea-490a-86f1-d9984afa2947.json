  "description": "There are `n` tasks assigned to you. The task times are represented as an integer array `tasks` of length `n`, where the `ith` task takes `tasks[i]` hours to finish. A **work session** is when you work for **at most** `sessionTime` consecutive hours and then take a break.\n\nYou should finish the given tasks in a way that satisfies the following conditions:\n\n*   If you start a task in a work session, you must complete it in the **same** work session.\n*   You can start a new task **immediately** after finishing the previous one.\n*   You may complete the tasks in **any order**.\n\nGiven `tasks` and `sessionTime`, return _the **minimum** number of **work sessions** needed to finish all the tasks following the conditions above._\n\nThe tests are generated such that `sessionTime` is **greater** than or **equal** to the **maximum** element in `tasks[i]`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** tasks = \\[1,2,3\\], sessionTime = 3\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** You can finish the tasks in two work sessions.\n- First work session: finish the first and the second tasks in 1 + 2 = 3 hours.\n- Second work session: finish the third task in 3 hours.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** tasks = \\[3,1,3,1,1\\], sessionTime = 8\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** You can finish the tasks in two work sessions.\n- First work session: finish all the tasks except the last one in 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 8 hours.\n- Second work session: finish the last task in 1 hour.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** tasks = \\[1,2,3,4,5\\], sessionTime = 15\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** You can finish all the tasks in one work session.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == tasks.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 14`\n*   `1 <= tasks[i] <= 10`\n*   `max(tasks[i]) <= sessionTime <= 15`",
