  "slug": "largest-merge-of-two-strings",
  "description": "You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. You want to construct a string `merge` in the following way: while either `word1` or `word2` are non-empty, choose **one** of the following options:\n\n*   If `word1` is non-empty, append the **first** character in `word1` to `merge` and delete it from `word1`.\n    *   For example, if `word1 = \"abc \"` and `merge = \"dv \"`, then after choosing this operation, `word1 = \"bc \"` and `merge = \"dva \"`.\n*   If `word2` is non-empty, append the **first** character in `word2` to `merge` and delete it from `word2`.\n    *   For example, if `word2 = \"abc \"` and `merge = \" \"`, then after choosing this operation, `word2 = \"bc \"` and `merge = \"a \"`.\n\nReturn _the lexicographically **largest**_ `merge` _you can construct_.\n\nA string `a` is lexicographically larger than a string `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, `a` has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character in `b`. For example, `\"abcd \"` is lexicographically larger than `\"abcc \"` because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and `d` is greater than `c`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** word1 =  \"cabaa \", word2 =  \"bcaaa \"\n**Output:**  \"cbcabaaaaa \"\n**Explanation:** One way to get the lexicographically largest merge is:\n- Take from word1: merge =  \"c \", word1 =  \"abaa \", word2 =  \"bcaaa \"\n- Take from word2: merge =  \"cb \", word1 =  \"abaa \", word2 =  \"caaa \"\n- Take from word2: merge =  \"cbc \", word1 =  \"abaa \", word2 =  \"aaa \"\n- Take from word1: merge =  \"cbca \", word1 =  \"baa \", word2 =  \"aaa \"\n- Take from word1: merge =  \"cbcab \", word1 =  \"aa \", word2 =  \"aaa \"\n- Append the remaining 5 a's from word1 and word2 at the end of merge.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** word1 =  \"abcabc \", word2 =  \"abdcaba \"\n**Output:**  \"abdcabcabcaba \"\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 3000`\n*   `word1` and `word2` consist only of lowercase English letters.",
