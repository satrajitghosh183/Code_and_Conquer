  "description": "You are given an integer array `cookies`, where `cookies[i]` denotes the number of cookies in the `ith` bag. You are also given an integer `k` that denotes the number of children to distribute **all** the bags of cookies to. All the cookies in the same bag must go to the same child and cannot be split up.\n\nThe **unfairness** of a distribution is defined as the **maximum** **total** cookies obtained by a single child in the distribution.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** unfairness of all distributions_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** cookies = \\[8,15,10,20,8\\], k = 2\n**Output:** 31\n**Explanation:** One optimal distribution is \\[8,15,8\\] and \\[10,20\\]\n- The 1st child receives \\[8,15,8\\] which has a total of 8 + 15 + 8 = 31 cookies.\n- The 2nd child receives \\[10,20\\] which has a total of 10 + 20 = 30 cookies.\nThe unfairness of the distribution is max(31,30) = 31.\nIt can be shown that there is no distribution with an unfairness less than 31.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** cookies = \\[6,1,3,2,2,4,1,2\\], k = 3\n**Output:** 7\n**Explanation:** One optimal distribution is \\[6,1\\], \\[3,2,2\\], and \\[4,1,2\\]\n- The 1st child receives \\[6,1\\] which has a total of 6 + 1 = 7 cookies.\n- The 2nd child receives \\[3,2,2\\] which has a total of 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 cookies.\n- The 3rd child receives \\[4,1,2\\] which has a total of 4 + 1 + 2 = 7 cookies.\nThe unfairness of the distribution is max(7,7,7) = 7.\nIt can be shown that there is no distribution with an unfairness less than 7.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= cookies.length <= 8`\n*   `1 <= cookies[i] <= 105`\n*   `2 <= k <= cookies.length`",
