  "description": "You are given an undirected weighted graph of `n` nodes (0-indexed), represented by an edge list where `edges[i] = [a, b]` is an undirected edge connecting the nodes `a` and `b` with a probability of success of traversing that edge `succProb[i]`.\n\nGiven two nodes `start` and `end`, find the path with the maximum probability of success to go from `start` to `end` and return its success probability.\n\nIf there is no path from `start` to `end`, **return 0**. Your answer will be accepted if it differs from the correct answer by at most **1e-5**.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 3, edges = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[0,2\\]\\], succProb = \\[0.5,0.5,0.2\\], start = 0, end = 2\n**Output:** 0.25000\n**Explanation:** There are two paths from start to end, one having a probability of success = 0.2 and the other has 0.5 \\* 0.5 = 0.25.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 3, edges = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[0,2\\]\\], succProb = \\[0.5,0.5,0.3\\], start = 0, end = 2\n**Output:** 0.30000\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** n = 3, edges = \\[\\[0,1\\]\\], succProb = \\[0.5\\], start = 0, end = 2\n**Output:** 0.00000\n**Explanation:** There is no path between 0 and 2.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= n <= 10^4`\n*   `0 <= start, end < n`\n*   `start != end`\n*   `0 <= a, b < n`\n*   `a != b`\n*   `0 <= succProb.length == edges.length <= 2*10^4`\n*   `0 <= succProb[i] <= 1`\n*   There is at most one edge between every two nodes.",
