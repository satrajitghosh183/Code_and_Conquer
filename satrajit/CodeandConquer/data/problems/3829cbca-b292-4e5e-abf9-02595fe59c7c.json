  "slug": "sell-diminishing-valued-colored-balls",
  "description": "You have an `inventory` of different colored balls, and there is a customer that wants `orders` balls of **any** color.\n\nThe customer weirdly values the colored balls. Each colored ball's value is the number of balls **of that color** you currently have in your `inventory`. For example, if you own `6` yellow balls, the customer would pay `6` for the first yellow ball. After the transaction, there are only `5` yellow balls left, so the next yellow ball is then valued at `5` (i.e., the value of the balls decreases as you sell more to the customer).\n\nYou are given an integer array, `inventory`, where `inventory[i]` represents the number of balls of the `ith` color that you initially own. You are also given an integer `orders`, which represents the total number of balls that the customer wants. You can sell the balls **in any order**.\n\nReturn _the **maximum** total value that you can attain after selling_ `orders` _colored balls_. As the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** inventory = \\[2,5\\], orders = 4\n**Output:** 14\n**Explanation:** Sell the 1st color 1 time (2) and the 2nd color 3 times (5 + 4 + 3).\nThe maximum total value is 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 14.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** inventory = \\[3,5\\], orders = 6\n**Output:** 19\n**Explanation:** Sell the 1st color 2 times (3 + 2) and the 2nd color 4 times (5 + 4 + 3 + 2).\nThe maximum total value is 3 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 19.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= inventory.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= inventory[i] <= 109`\n*   `1 <= orders <= min(sum(inventory[i]), 109)`",
