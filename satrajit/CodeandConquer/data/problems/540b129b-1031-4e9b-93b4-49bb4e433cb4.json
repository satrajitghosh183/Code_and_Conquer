  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n`.\n\n`nums` contains a **valid split** at index `i` if the following are true:\n\n*   The sum of the first `i + 1` elements is **greater than or equal to** the sum of the last `n - i - 1` elements.\n*   There is **at least one** element to the right of `i`. That is, `0 <= i < n - 1`.\n\nReturn _the number of **valid splits** in_ `nums`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[10,4,-8,7\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** \nThere are three ways of splitting nums into two non-empty parts:\n- Split nums at index 0. Then, the first part is \\[10\\], and its sum is 10. The second part is \\[4,-8,7\\], and its sum is 3. Since 10 >= 3, i = 0 is a valid split.\n- Split nums at index 1. Then, the first part is \\[10,4\\], and its sum is 14. The second part is \\[-8,7\\], and its sum is -1. Since 14 >= -1, i = 1 is a valid split.\n- Split nums at index 2. Then, the first part is \\[10,4,-8\\], and its sum is 6. The second part is \\[7\\], and its sum is 7. Since 6 < 7, i = 2 is not a valid split.\nThus, the number of valid splits in nums is 2.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[2,3,1,0\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** \nThere are two valid splits in nums:\n- Split nums at index 1. Then, the first part is \\[2,3\\], and its sum is 5. The second part is \\[1,0\\], and its sum is 1. Since 5 >= 1, i = 1 is a valid split. \n- Split nums at index 2. Then, the first part is \\[2,3,1\\], and its sum is 6. The second part is \\[0\\], and its sum is 0. Since 6 >= 0, i = 2 is a valid split.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= nums.length <= 105`\n*   `-105 <= nums[i] <= 105`",
