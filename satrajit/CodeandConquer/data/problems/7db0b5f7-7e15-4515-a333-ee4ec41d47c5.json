  "slug": "take-gifts-from-the-richest-pile",
  "description": "You are given an integer array `gifts` denoting the number of gifts in various piles. Every second, you do the following:\n\n*   Choose the pile with the maximum number of gifts.\n*   If there is more than one pile with the maximum number of gifts, choose any.\n*   Leave behind the floor of the square root of the number of gifts in the pile. Take the rest of the gifts.\n\nReturn _the number of gifts remaining after_ `k` _seconds._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** gifts = \\[25,64,9,4,100\\], k = 4\n**Output:** 29\n**Explanation:** \nThe gifts are taken in the following way:\n- In the first second, the last pile is chosen and 10 gifts are left behind.\n- Then the second pile is chosen and 8 gifts are left behind.\n- After that the first pile is chosen and 5 gifts are left behind.\n- Finally, the last pile is chosen again and 3 gifts are left behind.\nThe final remaining gifts are \\[5,8,9,4,3\\], so the total number of gifts remaining is 29.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** gifts = \\[1,1,1,1\\], k = 4\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** \nIn this case, regardless which pile you choose, you have to leave behind 1 gift in each pile. \nThat is, you can't take any pile with you. \nSo, the total gifts remaining are 4.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= gifts.length <= 103`\n*   `1 <= gifts[i] <= 109`\n*   `1 <= k <= 103`",
