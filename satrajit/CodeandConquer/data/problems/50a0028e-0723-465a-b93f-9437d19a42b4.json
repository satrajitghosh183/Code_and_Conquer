  "description": "There is a hotel with `n` rooms. The rooms are represented by a 2D integer array `rooms` where `rooms[i] = [roomIdi, sizei]` denotes that there is a room with room number `roomIdi` and size equal to `sizei`. Each `roomIdi` is guaranteed to be **unique**.\n\nYou are also given `k` queries in a 2D array `queries` where `queries[j] = [preferredj, minSizej]`. The answer to the `jth` query is the room number `id` of a room such that:\n\n*   The room has a size of **at least** `minSizej`, and\n*   `abs(id - preferredj)` is **minimized**, where `abs(x)` is the absolute value of `x`.\n\nIf there is a **tie** in the absolute difference, then use the room with the **smallest** such `id`. If there is **no such room**, the answer is `-1`.\n\nReturn _an array_ `answer` _of length_ `k` _where_ `answer[j]` _contains the answer to the_ `jth` _query_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** rooms = \\[\\[2,2\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[3,2\\]\\], queries = \\[\\[3,1\\],\\[3,3\\],\\[5,2\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[3,-1,3\\]\n**Explanation:** The answers to the queries are as follows:\nQuery = \\[3,1\\]: Room number 3 is the closest as abs(3 - 3) = 0, and its size of 2 is at least 1. The answer is 3.\nQuery = \\[3,3\\]: There are no rooms with a size of at least 3, so the answer is -1.\nQuery = \\[5,2\\]: Room number 3 is the closest as abs(3 - 5) = 2, and its size of 2 is at least 2. The answer is 3.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** rooms = \\[\\[1,4\\],\\[2,3\\],\\[3,5\\],\\[4,1\\],\\[5,2\\]\\], queries = \\[\\[2,3\\],\\[2,4\\],\\[2,5\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[2,1,3\\]\n**Explanation:** The answers to the queries are as follows:\nQuery = \\[2,3\\]: Room number 2 is the closest as abs(2 - 2) = 0, and its size of 3 is at least 3. The answer is 2.\nQuery = \\[2,4\\]: Room numbers 1 and 3 both have sizes of at least 4. The answer is 1 since it is smaller.\nQuery = \\[2,5\\]: Room number 3 is the only room with a size of at least 5. The answer is 3.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == rooms.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 105`\n*   `k == queries.length`\n*   `1 <= k <= 104`\n*   `1 <= roomIdi, preferredj <= 107`\n*   `1 <= sizei, minSizej <= 107`",
