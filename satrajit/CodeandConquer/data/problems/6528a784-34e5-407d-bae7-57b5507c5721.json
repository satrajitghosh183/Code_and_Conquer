  "description": "You are given an integer array `banned` and two integers `n` and `maxSum`. You are choosing some number of integers following the below rules:\n\n*   The chosen integers have to be in the range `[1, n]`.\n*   Each integer can be chosen **at most once**.\n*   The chosen integers should not be in the array `banned`.\n*   The sum of the chosen integers should not exceed `maxSum`.\n\nReturn _the **maximum** number of integers you can choose following the mentioned rules_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** banned = \\[1,6,5\\], n = 5, maxSum = 6\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** You can choose the integers 2 and 4.\n2 and 4 are from the range \\[1, 5\\], both did not appear in banned, and their sum is 6, which did not exceed maxSum.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** banned = \\[1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\], n = 8, maxSum = 1\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** You cannot choose any integer while following the mentioned conditions.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** banned = \\[11\\], n = 7, maxSum = 50\n**Output:** 7\n**Explanation:** You can choose the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\nThey are from the range \\[1, 7\\], all did not appear in banned, and their sum is 28, which did not exceed maxSum.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= banned.length <= 104`\n*   `1 <= banned[i], n <= 104`\n*   `1 <= maxSum <= 109`",
