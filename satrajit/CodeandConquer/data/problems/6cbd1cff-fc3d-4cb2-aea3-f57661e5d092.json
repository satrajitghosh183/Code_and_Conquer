  "description": "You are given `n`​​​​​​ tasks labeled from `0` to `n - 1` represented by a 2D integer array `tasks`, where `tasks[i] = [enqueueTimei, processingTimei]` means that the `i​​​​​​th`​​​​ task will be available to process at `enqueueTimei` and will take `processingTimei` to finish processing.\n\nYou have a single-threaded CPU that can process **at most one** task at a time and will act in the following way:\n\n*   If the CPU is idle and there are no available tasks to process, the CPU remains idle.\n*   If the CPU is idle and there are available tasks, the CPU will choose the one with the **shortest processing time**. If multiple tasks have the same shortest processing time, it will choose the task with the smallest index.\n*   Once a task is started, the CPU will **process the entire task** without stopping.\n*   The CPU can finish a task then start a new one instantly.\n\nReturn _the order in which the CPU will process the tasks._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** tasks = \\[\\[1,2\\],\\[2,4\\],\\[3,2\\],\\[4,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[0,2,3,1\\]\n**Explanation:** The events go as follows: \n- At time = 1, task 0 is available to process. Available tasks = {0}.\n- Also at time = 1, the idle CPU starts processing task 0. Available tasks = {}.\n- At time = 2, task 1 is available to process. Available tasks = {1}.\n- At time = 3, task 2 is available to process. Available tasks = {1, 2}.\n- Also at time = 3, the CPU finishes task 0 and starts processing task 2 as it is the shortest. Available tasks = {1}.\n- At time = 4, task 3 is available to process. Available tasks = {1, 3}.\n- At time = 5, the CPU finishes task 2 and starts processing task 3 as it is the shortest. Available tasks = {1}.\n- At time = 6, the CPU finishes task 3 and starts processing task 1. Available tasks = {}.\n- At time = 10, the CPU finishes task 1 and becomes idle.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** tasks = \\[\\[7,10\\],\\[7,12\\],\\[7,5\\],\\[7,4\\],\\[7,2\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[4,3,2,0,1\\]\n**Explanation****:** The events go as follows:\n- At time = 7, all the tasks become available. Available tasks = {0,1,2,3,4}.\n- Also at time = 7, the idle CPU starts processing task 4. Available tasks = {0,1,2,3}.\n- At time = 9, the CPU finishes task 4 and starts processing task 3. Available tasks = {0,1,2}.\n- At time = 13, the CPU finishes task 3 and starts processing task 2. Available tasks = {0,1}.\n- At time = 18, the CPU finishes task 2 and starts processing task 0. Available tasks = {1}.\n- At time = 28, the CPU finishes task 0 and starts processing task 1. Available tasks = {}.\n- At time = 40, the CPU finishes task 1 and becomes idle.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `tasks.length == n`\n*   `1 <= n <= 105`\n*   `1 <= enqueueTimei, processingTimei <= 109`",
