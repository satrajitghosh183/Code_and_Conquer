  "description": "Along a long library corridor, there is a line of seats and decorative plants. You are given a **0-indexed** string `corridor` of length `n` consisting of letters `'S'` and `'P'` where each `'S'` represents a seat and each `'P'` represents a plant.\n\nOne room divider has **already** been installed to the left of index `0`, and **another** to the right of index `n - 1`. Additional room dividers can be installed. For each position between indices `i - 1` and `i` (`1 <= i <= n - 1`), at most one divider can be installed.\n\nDivide the corridor into non-overlapping sections, where each section has **exactly two seats** with any number of plants. There may be multiple ways to perform the division. Two ways are **different** if there is a position with a room divider installed in the first way but not in the second way.\n\nReturn _the number of ways to divide the corridor_. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`. If there is no way, return `0`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** corridor =  \"SSPPSPS \"\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** There are 3 different ways to divide the corridor.\nThe black bars in the above image indicate the two room dividers already installed.\nNote that in each of the ways, **each** section has exactly **two** seats.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** corridor =  \"PPSPSP \"\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** There is only 1 way to divide the corridor, by not installing any additional dividers.\nInstalling any would create some section that does not have exactly two seats.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** corridor =  \"S \"\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** There is no way to divide the corridor because there will always be a section that does not have exactly two seats.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == corridor.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 105`\n*   `corridor[i]` is either `'S'` or `'P'`.",
