  "description": "You are given an array of strings `ideas` that represents a list of names to be used in the process of naming a company. The process of naming a company is as follows:\n\n1.  Choose 2 **distinct** names from `ideas`, call them `ideaA` and `ideaB`.\n2.  Swap the first letters of `ideaA` and `ideaB` with each other.\n3.  If **both** of the new names are not found in the original `ideas`, then the name `ideaA ideaB` (the **concatenation** of `ideaA` and `ideaB`, separated by a space) is a valid company name.\n4.  Otherwise, it is not a valid name.\n\nReturn _the number of **distinct** valid names for the company_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** ideas = \\[ \"coffee \", \"donuts \", \"time \", \"toffee \"\\]\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:** The following selections are valid:\n- ( \"coffee \",  \"donuts \"): The company name created is  \"doffee conuts \".\n- ( \"donuts \",  \"coffee \"): The company name created is  \"conuts doffee \".\n- ( \"donuts \",  \"time \"): The company name created is  \"tonuts dime \".\n- ( \"donuts \",  \"toffee \"): The company name created is  \"tonuts doffee \".\n- ( \"time \",  \"donuts \"): The company name created is  \"dime tonuts \".\n- ( \"toffee \",  \"donuts \"): The company name created is  \"doffee tonuts \".\nTherefore, there are a total of 6 distinct company names.\n\nThe following are some examples of invalid selections:\n- ( \"coffee \",  \"time \"): The name  \"toffee \" formed after swapping already exists in the original array.\n- ( \"time \",  \"toffee \"): Both names are still the same after swapping and exist in the original array.\n- ( \"coffee \",  \"toffee \"): Both names formed after swapping already exist in the original array.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** ideas = \\[ \"lack \", \"back \"\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** There are no valid selections. Therefore, 0 is returned.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= ideas.length <= 5 * 104`\n*   `1 <= ideas[i].length <= 10`\n*   `ideas[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.\n*   All the strings in `ideas` are **unique**.",
