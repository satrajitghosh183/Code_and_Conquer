  "title": "Longest Common Subpath",
  "slug": "longest-common-subpath",
  "description": "There is a country of `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. In this country, there is a road connecting **every pair** of cities.\n\nThere are `m` friends numbered from `0` to `m - 1` who are traveling through the country. Each one of them will take a path consisting of some cities. Each path is represented by an integer array that contains the visited cities in order. The path may contain a city **more than once**, but the same city will not be listed consecutively.\n\nGiven an integer `n` and a 2D integer array `paths` where `paths[i]` is an integer array representing the path of the `ith` friend, return _the length of the **longest common subpath** that is shared by **every** friend's path, or_ `0` _if there is no common subpath at all_.\n\nA **subpath** of a path is a contiguous sequence of cities within that path.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 5, paths = \\[\\[0,1,2,3,4\\],\n                       \\[2,3,4\\],\n                       \\[4,0,1,2,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** The longest common subpath is \\[2,3\\].\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 3, paths = \\[\\[0\\],\\[1\\],\\[2\\]\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** There is no common subpath shared by the three paths.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** n = 5, paths = \\[\\[0,1,2,3,4\\],\n                       \\[4,3,2,1,0\\]\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** The possible longest common subpaths are \\[0\\], \\[1\\], \\[2\\], \\[3\\], and \\[4\\]. All have a length of 1.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= n <= 105`\n*   `m == paths.length`\n*   `2 <= m <= 105`\n*   `sum(paths[i].length) <= 105`\n*   `0 <= paths[i][j] < n`\n*   The same city is not listed multiple times consecutively in `paths[i]`.",
