  "description": "There is a party where `n` friends numbered from `0` to `n - 1` are attending. There is an **infinite** number of chairs in this party that are numbered from `0` to `infinity`. When a friend arrives at the party, they sit on the unoccupied chair with the **smallest number**.\n\n*   For example, if chairs `0`, `1`, and `5` are occupied when a friend comes, they will sit on chair number `2`.\n\nWhen a friend leaves the party, their chair becomes unoccupied at the moment they leave. If another friend arrives at that same moment, they can sit in that chair.\n\nYou are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `times` where `times[i] = [arrivali, leavingi]`, indicating the arrival and leaving times of the `ith` friend respectively, and an integer `targetFriend`. All arrival times are **distinct**.\n\nReturn _the **chair number** that the friend numbered_ `targetFriend` _will sit on_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** times = \\[\\[1,4\\],\\[2,3\\],\\[4,6\\]\\], targetFriend = 1\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** \n- Friend 0 arrives at time 1 and sits on chair 0.\n- Friend 1 arrives at time 2 and sits on chair 1.\n- Friend 1 leaves at time 3 and chair 1 becomes empty.\n- Friend 0 leaves at time 4 and chair 0 becomes empty.\n- Friend 2 arrives at time 4 and sits on chair 0.\nSince friend 1 sat on chair 1, we return 1.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** times = \\[\\[3,10\\],\\[1,5\\],\\[2,6\\]\\], targetFriend = 0\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** \n- Friend 1 arrives at time 1 and sits on chair 0.\n- Friend 2 arrives at time 2 and sits on chair 1.\n- Friend 0 arrives at time 3 and sits on chair 2.\n- Friend 1 leaves at time 5 and chair 0 becomes empty.\n- Friend 2 leaves at time 6 and chair 1 becomes empty.\n- Friend 0 leaves at time 10 and chair 2 becomes empty.\nSince friend 0 sat on chair 2, we return 2.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == times.length`\n*   `2 <= n <= 104`\n*   `times[i].length == 2`\n*   `1 <= arrivali < leavingi <= 105`\n*   `0 <= targetFriend <= n - 1`\n*   Each `arrivali` time is **distinct**.",
