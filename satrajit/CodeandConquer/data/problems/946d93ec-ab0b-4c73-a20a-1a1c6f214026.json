  "title": "Maximum Score of a Node Sequence",
  "slug": "maximum-score-of-a-node-sequence",
  "description": "There is an **undirected** graph with `n` nodes, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.\n\nYou are given a **0-indexed** integer array `scores` of length `n` where `scores[i]` denotes the score of node `i`. You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` denotes that there exists an **undirected** edge connecting nodes `ai` and `bi`.\n\nA node sequence is **valid** if it meets the following conditions:\n\n*   There is an edge connecting every pair of **adjacent** nodes in the sequence.\n*   No node appears more than once in the sequence.\n\nThe score of a node sequence is defined as the **sum** of the scores of the nodes in the sequence.\n\nReturn _the **maximum score** of a valid node sequence with a length of_ `4`_._ If no such sequence exists, return `-1`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** scores = \\[5,2,9,8,4\\], edges = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[2,3\\],\\[0,2\\],\\[1,3\\],\\[2,4\\]\\]\n**Output:** 24\n**Explanation:** The figure above shows the graph and the chosen node sequence \\[0,1,2,3\\].\nThe score of the node sequence is 5 + 2 + 9 + 8 = 24.\nIt can be shown that no other node sequence has a score of more than 24.\nNote that the sequences \\[3,1,2,0\\] and \\[1,0,2,3\\] are also valid and have a score of 24.\nThe sequence \\[0,3,2,4\\] is not valid since no edge connects nodes 0 and 3.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** scores = \\[9,20,6,4,11,12\\], edges = \\[\\[0,3\\],\\[5,3\\],\\[2,4\\],\\[1,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** -1\n**Explanation:** The figure above shows the graph.\nThere are no valid node sequences of length 4, so we return -1.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == scores.length`\n*   `4 <= n <= 5 * 104`\n*   `1 <= scores[i] <= 108`\n*   `0 <= edges.length <= 5 * 104`\n*   `edges[i].length == 2`\n*   `0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1`\n*   `ai != bi`\n*   There are no duplicate edges.",
