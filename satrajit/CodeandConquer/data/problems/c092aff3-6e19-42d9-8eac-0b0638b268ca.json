  "description": "A string `s` is called **good** if there are no two different characters in `s` that have the same **frequency**.\n\nGiven a string `s`, return _the **minimum** number of characters you need to delete to make_ `s` _**good**._\n\nThe **frequency** of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string. For example, in the string `\"aab \"`, the **frequency** of `'a'` is `2`, while the **frequency** of `'b'` is `1`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"aab \"\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** `s` is already good.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"aaabbbcc \"\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** You can delete two 'b's resulting in the good string  \"aaabcc \".\nAnother way it to delete one 'b' and one 'c' resulting in the good string  \"aaabbc \".\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"ceabaacb \"\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** You can delete both 'c's resulting in the good string  \"eabaab \".\nNote that we only care about characters that are still in the string at the end (i.e. frequency of 0 is ignored).\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= s.length <= 105`\n*   `s` contains only lowercase English letters.",
