  "description": "You are given four integers `minLength`, `maxLength`, `oneGroup` and `zeroGroup`.\n\nA binary string is **good** if it satisfies the following conditions:\n\n*   The length of the string is in the range `[minLength, maxLength]`.\n*   The size of each block of consecutive `1`'s is a multiple of `oneGroup`.\n    *   For example in a binary string `00110111100` sizes of each block of consecutive ones are `[2,4]`.\n*   The size of each block of consecutive `0`'s is a multiple of `zeroGroup`.\n    *   For example, in a binary string `00110111100` sizes of each block of consecutive ones are `[2,1,2]`.\n\nReturn _the number of **good** binary strings_. Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.\n\n**Note** that `0` is considered a multiple of all the numbers.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** minLength = 2, maxLength = 3, oneGroup = 1, zeroGroup = 2\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** There are 5 good binary strings in this example:  \"00 \",  \"11 \",  \"001 \",  \"100 \", and  \"111 \".\nIt can be proven that there are only 5 good strings satisfying all conditions.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** minLength = 4, maxLength = 4, oneGroup = 4, zeroGroup = 3\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** There is only 1 good binary string in this example:  \"1111 \".\nIt can be proven that there is only 1 good string satisfying all conditions.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= minLength <= maxLength <= 105`\n*   `1 <= oneGroup, zeroGroup <= maxLength`",
