  "title": "Shortest Cycle in a Graph",
  "slug": "shortest-cycle-in-a-graph",
  "description": "There is a **bi-directional** graph with `n` vertices, where each vertex is labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. The edges in the graph are represented by a given 2D integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` denotes an edge between vertex `ui` and vertex `vi`. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.\n\nReturn _the length of the **shortest** cycle in the graph_. If no cycle exists, return `-1`.\n\nA cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node, and each edge in the path is used only once.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 7, edges = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[2,0\\],\\[3,4\\],\\[4,5\\],\\[5,6\\],\\[6,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** The cycle with the smallest length is : 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0 \n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 4, edges = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[0,2\\]\\]\n**Output:** -1\n**Explanation:** There are no cycles in this graph.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= n <= 1000`\n*   `1 <= edges.length <= 1000`\n*   `edges[i].length == 2`\n*   `0 <= ui, vi < n`\n*   `ui != vi`\n*   There are no repeated edges.",
