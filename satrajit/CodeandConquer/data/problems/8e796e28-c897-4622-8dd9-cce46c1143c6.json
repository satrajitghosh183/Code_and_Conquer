  "description": "A cell `(r, c)` of an excel sheet is represented as a string `\" \"` where:\n\n*   denotes the column number `c` of the cell. It is represented by **alphabetical letters**.\n    *   For example, the `1st` column is denoted by `'A'`, the `2nd` by `'B'`, the `3rd` by `'C'`, and so on.\n*   is the row number `r` of the cell. The `rth` row is represented by the **integer** `r`.\n\nYou are given a string `s` in the format `\": \"`, where represents the column `c1`, represents the row `r1`, represents the column `c2`, and represents the row `r2`, such that `r1 <= r2` and `c1 <= c2`.\n\nReturn _the **list of cells**_ `(x, y)` _such that_ `r1 <= x <= r2` _and_ `c1 <= y <= c2`. The cells should be represented as **strings** in the format mentioned above and be sorted in **non-decreasing** order first by columns and then by rows.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"K1:L2 \"\n**Output:** \\[ \"K1 \", \"K2 \", \"L1 \", \"L2 \"\\]\n**Explanation:**\nThe above diagram shows the cells which should be present in the list.\nThe red arrows denote the order in which the cells should be presented.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"A1:F1 \"\n**Output:** \\[ \"A1 \", \"B1 \", \"C1 \", \"D1 \", \"E1 \", \"F1 \"\\]\n**Explanation:**\nThe above diagram shows the cells which should be present in the list.\nThe red arrow denotes the order in which the cells should be presented.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `s.length == 5`\n*   `'A' <= s[0] <= s[3] <= 'Z'`\n*   `'1' <= s[1] <= s[4] <= '9'`\n*   `s` consists of uppercase English letters, digits and `':'`.",
