  "slug": "maximum-path-quality-of-a-graph",
  "description": "There is an **undirected** graph with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` (**inclusive**). You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `values` where `values[i]` is the **value** of the `ith` node. You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `edges`, where each `edges[j] = [uj, vj, timej]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between the nodes `uj` and `vj`, and it takes `timej` seconds to travel between the two nodes. Finally, you are given an integer `maxTime`.\n\nA **valid** **path** in the graph is any path that starts at node `0`, ends at node `0`, and takes **at most** `maxTime` seconds to complete. You may visit the same node multiple times. The **quality** of a valid path is the **sum** of the values of the **unique nodes** visited in the path (each node's value is added **at most once** to the sum).\n\nReturn _the **maximum** quality of a valid path_.\n\n**Note:** There are **at most four** edges connected to each node.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** values = \\[0,32,10,43\\], edges = \\[\\[0,1,10\\],\\[1,2,15\\],\\[0,3,10\\]\\], maxTime = 49\n**Output:** 75\n**Explanation:**\nOne possible path is 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 3 -> 0. The total time taken is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 <= 49.\nThe nodes visited are 0, 1, and 3, giving a maximal path quality of 0 + 32 + 43 = 75.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** values = \\[5,10,15,20\\], edges = \\[\\[0,1,10\\],\\[1,2,10\\],\\[0,3,10\\]\\], maxTime = 30\n**Output:** 25\n**Explanation:**\nOne possible path is 0 -> 3 -> 0. The total time taken is 10 + 10 = 20 <= 30.\nThe nodes visited are 0 and 3, giving a maximal path quality of 5 + 20 = 25.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** values = \\[1,2,3,4\\], edges = \\[\\[0,1,10\\],\\[1,2,11\\],\\[2,3,12\\],\\[1,3,13\\]\\], maxTime = 50\n**Output:** 7\n**Explanation:**\nOne possible path is 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 0. The total time taken is 10 + 13 + 13 + 10 = 46 <= 50.\nThe nodes visited are 0, 1, and 3, giving a maximal path quality of 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == values.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 1000`\n*   `0 <= values[i] <= 108`\n*   `0 <= edges.length <= 2000`\n*   `edges[j].length == 3`\n*   `0 <= uj < vj <= n - 1`\n*   `10 <= timej, maxTime <= 100`\n*   All the pairs `[uj, vj]` are **unique**.\n*   There are **at most four** edges connected to each node.\n*   The graph may not be connected.",
