  "title": "Sort Features by Popularity",
  "slug": "sort-features-by-popularity",
  "description": "You are given a string array `features` where `features[i]` is a single word that represents the name of a feature of the latest product you are working on. You have made a survey where users have reported which features they like. You are given a string array `responses`, where each `responses[i]` is a string containing space-separated words.\n\nThe **popularity** of a feature is the number of `responses[i]` that contain the feature. You want to sort the features in non-increasing order by their popularity. If two features have the same popularity, order them by their original index in `features`. Notice that one response could contain the same feature multiple times; this feature is only counted once in its popularity.\n\nReturn _the features in sorted order._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** features = \\[ \"cooler \", \"lock \", \"touch \"\\], responses = \\[ \"i like cooler cooler \", \"lock touch cool \", \"locker like touch \"\\]\n**Output:** \\[ \"touch \", \"cooler \", \"lock \"\\]\n**Explanation:** appearances( \"cooler \") = 1, appearances( \"lock \") = 1, appearances( \"touch \") = 2. Since  \"cooler \" and  \"lock \" both had 1 appearance,  \"cooler \" comes first because  \"cooler \" came first in the features array.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** features = \\[ \"a \", \"aa \", \"b \", \"c \"\\], responses = \\[ \"a \", \"a aa \", \"a a a a a \", \"b a \"\\]\n**Output:** \\[ \"a \", \"aa \", \"b \", \"c \"\\]\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= features.length <= 104`\n*   `1 <= features[i].length <= 10`\n*   `features` contains no duplicates.\n*   `features[i]` consists of lowercase letters.\n*   `1 <= responses.length <= 102`\n*   `1 <= responses[i].length <= 103`\n*   `responses[i]` consists of lowercase letters and spaces.\n*   `responses[i]` contains no two consecutive spaces.\n*   `responses[i]` has no leading or trailing spaces.",
