  "description": "You have `n` bags numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `capacity` and `rocks`. The `ith` bag can hold a maximum of `capacity[i]` rocks and currently contains `rocks[i]` rocks. You are also given an integer `additionalRocks`, the number of additional rocks you can place in **any** of the bags.\n\nReturn _the **maximum** number of bags that could have full capacity after placing the additional rocks in some bags._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** capacity = \\[2,3,4,5\\], rocks = \\[1,2,4,4\\], additionalRocks = 2\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:**\nPlace 1 rock in bag 0 and 1 rock in bag 1.\nThe number of rocks in each bag are now \\[2,3,4,4\\].\nBags 0, 1, and 2 have full capacity.\nThere are 3 bags at full capacity, so we return 3.\nIt can be shown that it is not possible to have more than 3 bags at full capacity.\nNote that there may be other ways of placing the rocks that result in an answer of 3.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** capacity = \\[10,2,2\\], rocks = \\[2,2,0\\], additionalRocks = 100\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:**\nPlace 8 rocks in bag 0 and 2 rocks in bag 2.\nThe number of rocks in each bag are now \\[10,2,2\\].\nBags 0, 1, and 2 have full capacity.\nThere are 3 bags at full capacity, so we return 3.\nIt can be shown that it is not possible to have more than 3 bags at full capacity.\nNote that we did not use all of the additional rocks.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == capacity.length == rocks.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 5 * 104`\n*   `1 <= capacity[i] <= 109`\n*   `0 <= rocks[i] <= capacity[i]`\n*   `1 <= additionalRocks <= 109`",
