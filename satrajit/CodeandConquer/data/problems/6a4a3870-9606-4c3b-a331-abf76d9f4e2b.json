  "description": "A **valid cut** in a circle can be:\n\n*   A cut that is represented by a straight line that touches two points on the edge of the circle and passes through its center, or\n*   A cut that is represented by a straight line that touches one point on the edge of the circle and its center.\n\nSome valid and invalid cuts are shown in the figures below.\n\nGiven the integer `n`, return _the **minimum** number of cuts needed to divide a circle into_ `n` _equal slices_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 4\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** \nThe above figure shows how cutting the circle twice through the middle divides it into 4 equal slices.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 3\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:**\nAt least 3 cuts are needed to divide the circle into 3 equal slices. \nIt can be shown that less than 3 cuts cannot result in 3 slices of equal size and shape.\nAlso note that the first cut will not divide the circle into distinct parts.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= n <= 100`",
