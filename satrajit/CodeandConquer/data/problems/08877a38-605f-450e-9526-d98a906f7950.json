  "description": "There are `n` cars traveling at different speeds in the same direction along a one-lane road. You are given an array `cars` of length `n`, where `cars[i] = [positioni, speedi]` represents:\n\n*   `positioni` is the distance between the `ith` car and the beginning of the road in meters. It is guaranteed that `positioni < positioni+1`.\n*   `speedi` is the initial speed of the `ith` car in meters per second.\n\nFor simplicity, cars can be considered as points moving along the number line. Two cars collide when they occupy the same position. Once a car collides with another car, they unite and form a single car fleet. The cars in the formed fleet will have the same position and the same speed, which is the initial speed of the **slowest** car in the fleet.\n\nReturn an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the time, in seconds, at which the `ith` car collides with the next car, or `-1` if the car does not collide with the next car. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answers are accepted.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** cars = \\[\\[1,2\\],\\[2,1\\],\\[4,3\\],\\[7,2\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[1.00000,-1.00000,3.00000,-1.00000\\]\n**Explanation:** After exactly one second, the first car will collide with the second car, and form a car fleet with speed 1 m/s. After exactly 3 seconds, the third car will collide with the fourth car, and form a car fleet with speed 2 m/s.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** cars = \\[\\[3,4\\],\\[5,4\\],\\[6,3\\],\\[9,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[2.00000,1.00000,1.50000,-1.00000\\]\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= cars.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= positioni, speedi <= 106`\n*   `positioni < positioni+1`",
