  "description": "A sentence is a list of **tokens** separated by a **single** space with no leading or trailing spaces. Every token is either a **positive number** consisting of digits `0-9` with no leading zeros, or a **word** consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\n*   For example, `\"a puppy has 2 eyes 4 legs \"` is a sentence with seven tokens: `\"2 \"` and `\"4 \"` are numbers and the other tokens such as `\"puppy \"` are words.\n\nGiven a string `s` representing a sentence, you need to check if **all** the numbers in `s` are **strictly increasing** from left to right (i.e., other than the last number, **each** number is **strictly smaller** than the number on its **right** in `s`).\n\nReturn `true` _if so, or_ `false` _otherwise_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"1 box has 3 blue 4 red 6 green and 12 yellow marbles \"\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:** The numbers in s are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 12.\nThey are strictly increasing from left to right: 1 < 3 < 4 < 6 < 12.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"hello world 5 x 5 \"\n**Output:** false\n**Explanation:** The numbers in s are: **5**, **5**. They are not strictly increasing.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"sunset is at 7 51 pm overnight lows will be in the low 50 and 60 s \"\n**Output:** false\n**Explanation:** The numbers in s are: 7, **51**, **50**, 60. They are not strictly increasing.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `3 <= s.length <= 200`\n*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters, spaces, and digits from `0` to `9`, inclusive.\n*   The number of tokens in `s` is between `2` and `100`, inclusive.\n*   The tokens in `s` are separated by a single space.\n*   There are at least **two** numbers in `s`.\n*   Each number in `s` is a **positive** number **less** than `100`, with no leading zeros.\n*   `s` contains no leading or trailing spaces.",
