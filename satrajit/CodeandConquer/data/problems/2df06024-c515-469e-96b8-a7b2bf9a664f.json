  "description": "**Run-length encoding** is a compression algorithm that allows for an integer array `nums` with many segments of **consecutive repeated** numbers to be represented by a (generally smaller) 2D array `encoded`. Each `encoded[i] = [vali, freqi]` describes the `ith` segment of repeated numbers in `nums` where `vali` is the value that is repeated `freqi` times.\n\n*   For example, `nums = [1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2]` is represented by the **run-length encoded** array `encoded = [[1,3],[2,5]]`. Another way to read this is \"three `1`'s followed by five `2`'s \".\n\nThe **product** of two run-length encoded arrays `encoded1` and `encoded2` can be calculated using the following steps:\n\n1.  **Expand** both `encoded1` and `encoded2` into the full arrays `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.\n2.  Create a new array `prodNums` of length `nums1.length` and set `prodNums[i] = nums1[i] * nums2[i]`.\n3.  **Compress** `prodNums` into a run-length encoded array and return it.\n\nYou are given two **run-length encoded** arrays `encoded1` and `encoded2` representing full arrays `nums1` and `nums2` respectively. Both `nums1` and `nums2` have the **same length**. Each `encoded1[i] = [vali, freqi]` describes the `ith` segment of `nums1`, and each `encoded2[j] = [valj, freqj]` describes the `jth` segment of `nums2`.\n\nReturn _the **product** of_ `encoded1` _and_ `encoded2`.\n\n**Note:** Compression should be done such that the run-length encoded array has the **minimum** possible length.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** encoded1 = \\[\\[1,3\\],\\[2,3\\]\\], encoded2 = \\[\\[6,3\\],\\[3,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[\\[6,6\\]\\]\n**Explanation:** encoded1 expands to \\[1,1,1,2,2,2\\] and encoded2 expands to \\[6,6,6,3,3,3\\].\nprodNums = \\[6,6,6,6,6,6\\], which is compressed into the run-length encoded array \\[\\[6,6\\]\\].\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** encoded1 = \\[\\[1,3\\],\\[2,1\\],\\[3,2\\]\\], encoded2 = \\[\\[2,3\\],\\[3,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[\\[2,3\\],\\[6,1\\],\\[9,2\\]\\]\n**Explanation:** encoded1 expands to \\[1,1,1,2,3,3\\] and encoded2 expands to \\[2,2,2,3,3,3\\].\nprodNums = \\[2,2,2,6,9,9\\], which is compressed into the run-length encoded array \\[\\[2,3\\],\\[6,1\\],\\[9,2\\]\\].\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= encoded1.length, encoded2.length <= 105`\n*   `encoded1[i].length == 2`\n*   `encoded2[j].length == 2`\n*   `1 <= vali, freqi <= 104` for each `encoded1[i]`.\n*   `1 <= valj, freqj <= 104` for each `encoded2[j]`.\n*   The full arrays that `encoded1` and `encoded2` represent are the same length.",
