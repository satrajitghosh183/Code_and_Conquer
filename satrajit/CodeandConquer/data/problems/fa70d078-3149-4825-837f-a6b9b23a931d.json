  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. The array `nums` is **beautiful** if:\n\n*   `nums.length` is even.\n*   `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all `i % 2 == 0`.\n\nNote that an empty array is considered beautiful.\n\nYou can delete any number of elements from `nums`. When you delete an element, all the elements to the right of the deleted element will be **shifted one unit to the left** to fill the gap created and all the elements to the left of the deleted element will remain **unchanged**.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** number of elements to delete from_ `nums` _to make it_ _beautiful._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[1,1,2,3,5\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** You can delete either `nums[0]` or `nums[1]` to make `nums` = \\[1,2,3,5\\] which is beautiful. It can be proven you need at least 1 deletion to make `nums` beautiful.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[1,1,2,2,3,3\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** You can delete `nums[0]` and `nums[5]` to make nums = \\[1,2,2,3\\] which is beautiful. It can be proven you need at least 2 deletions to make nums beautiful.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`\n*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 105`",
