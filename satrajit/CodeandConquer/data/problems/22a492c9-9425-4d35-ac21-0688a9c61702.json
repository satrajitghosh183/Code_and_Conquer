  "description": "You are given a string `s` consisting of digits and an integer `k`.\n\nA **round** can be completed if the length of `s` is greater than `k`. In one round, do the following:\n\n1.  **Divide** `s` into **consecutive groups** of size `k` such that the first `k` characters are in the first group, the next `k` characters are in the second group, and so on. **Note** that the size of the last group can be smaller than `k`.\n2.  **Replace** each group of `s` with a string representing the sum of all its digits. For example, `\"346 \"` is replaced with `\"13 \"` because `3 + 4 + 6 = 13`.\n3.  **Merge** consecutive groups together to form a new string. If the length of the string is greater than `k`, repeat from step `1`.\n\nReturn `s` _after all rounds have been completed_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"11111222223 \", k = 3\n**Output:**  \"135 \"\n**Explanation:** \n- For the first round, we divide s into groups of size 3:  \"111 \",  \"112 \",  \"222 \", and  \"23 \".\n  ​​​​​Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, and 2 + 3 = 5. \n  So, s becomes  \"3 \" +  \"4 \" +  \"6 \" +  \"5 \" =  \"3465 \" after the first round.\n- For the second round, we divide s into  \"346 \" and  \"5 \".\n  Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13, 5 = 5. \n  So, s becomes  \"13 \" +  \"5 \" =  \"135 \" after second round. \nNow, s.length <= k, so we return  \"135 \" as the answer.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"00000000 \", k = 3\n**Output:**  \"000 \"\n**Explanation:** \nWe divide s into  \"000 \",  \"000 \", and  \"00 \".\nThen we calculate the digit sum of each group: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, and 0 + 0 = 0. \ns becomes  \"0 \" +  \"0 \" +  \"0 \" =  \"000 \", whose length is equal to k, so we return  \"000 \".\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= s.length <= 100`\n*   `2 <= k <= 100`\n*   `s` consists of digits only.",
