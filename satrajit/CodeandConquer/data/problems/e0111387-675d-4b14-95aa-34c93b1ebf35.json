  "description": "You are given an integer `n` indicating there are `n` specialty retail stores. There are `m` product types of varying amounts, which are given as a **0-indexed** integer array `quantities`, where `quantities[i]` represents the number of products of the `ith` product type.\n\nYou need to distribute **all products** to the retail stores following these rules:\n\n*   A store can only be given **at most one product type** but can be given **any** amount of it.\n*   After distribution, each store will have been given some number of products (possibly `0`). Let `x` represent the maximum number of products given to any store. You want `x` to be as small as possible, i.e., you want to **minimize** the **maximum** number of products that are given to any store.\n\nReturn _the minimum possible_ `x`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 6, quantities = \\[11,6\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** One optimal way is:\n- The 11 products of type 0 are distributed to the first four stores in these amounts: 2, 3, 3, 3\n- The 6 products of type 1 are distributed to the other two stores in these amounts: 3, 3\nThe maximum number of products given to any store is max(2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3) = 3.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 7, quantities = \\[15,10,10\\]\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** One optimal way is:\n- The 15 products of type 0 are distributed to the first three stores in these amounts: 5, 5, 5\n- The 10 products of type 1 are distributed to the next two stores in these amounts: 5, 5\n- The 10 products of type 2 are distributed to the last two stores in these amounts: 5, 5\nThe maximum number of products given to any store is max(5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5) = 5.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** n = 1, quantities = \\[100000\\]\n**Output:** 100000\n**Explanation:** The only optimal way is:\n- The 100000 products of type 0 are distributed to the only store.\nThe maximum number of products given to any store is max(100000) = 100000.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `m == quantities.length`\n*   `1 <= m <= n <= 105`\n*   `1 <= quantities[i] <= 105`",
