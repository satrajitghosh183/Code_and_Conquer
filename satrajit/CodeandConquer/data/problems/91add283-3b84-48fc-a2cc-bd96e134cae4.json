  "description": "Given a **directed acyclic graph**, with `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n-1`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi]` represents a directed edge from node `fromi` to node `toi`.\n\nFind _the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable_. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.\n\nNotice that you can return the vertices in any order.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 6, edges = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[0,2\\],\\[2,5\\],\\[3,4\\],\\[4,2\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[0,3\\]\n**Explanation:** It's not possible to reach all the nodes from a single vertex. From 0 we can reach \\[0,1,2,5\\]. From 3 we can reach \\[3,4,2,5\\]. So we output \\[0,3\\].\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 5, edges = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[2,1\\],\\[3,1\\],\\[1,4\\],\\[2,4\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[0,2,3\\]\n**Explanation:** Notice that vertices 0, 3 and 2 are not reachable from any other node, so we must include them. Also any of these vertices can reach nodes 1 and 4.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= n <= 10^5`\n*   `1 <= edges.length <= min(10^5, n * (n - 1) / 2)`\n*   `edges[i].length == 2`\n*   `0 <= fromi, toi < n`\n*   All pairs `(fromi, toi)` are distinct.",
