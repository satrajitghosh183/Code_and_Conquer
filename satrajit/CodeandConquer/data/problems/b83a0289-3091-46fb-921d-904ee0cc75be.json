  "title": "Maximum Number of Robots Within Budget",
  "slug": "maximum-number-of-robots-within-budget",
  "description": "You have `n` robots. You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays, `chargeTimes` and `runningCosts`, both of length `n`. The `ith` robot costs `chargeTimes[i]` units to charge and costs `runningCosts[i]` units to run. You are also given an integer `budget`.\n\nThe **total cost** of running `k` chosen robots is equal to `max(chargeTimes) + k * sum(runningCosts)`, where `max(chargeTimes)` is the largest charge cost among the `k` robots and `sum(runningCosts)` is the sum of running costs among the `k` robots.\n\nReturn _the **maximum** number of **consecutive** robots you can run such that the total cost **does not** exceed_ `budget`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** chargeTimes = \\[3,6,1,3,4\\], runningCosts = \\[2,1,3,4,5\\], budget = 25\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** \nIt is possible to run all individual and consecutive pairs of robots within budget.\nTo obtain answer 3, consider the first 3 robots. The total cost will be max(3,6,1) + 3 \\* sum(2,1,3) = 6 + 3 \\* 6 = 24 which is less than 25.\nIt can be shown that it is not possible to run more than 3 consecutive robots within budget, so we return 3.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** chargeTimes = \\[11,12,19\\], runningCosts = \\[10,8,7\\], budget = 19\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** No robot can be run that does not exceed the budget, so we return 0.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `chargeTimes.length == runningCosts.length == n`\n*   `1 <= n <= 5 * 104`\n*   `1 <= chargeTimes[i], runningCosts[i] <= 105`\n*   `1 <= budget <= 1015`",
