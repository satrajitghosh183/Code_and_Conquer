  "description": "A **[binary expression tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree)** is a kind of binary tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands (variables), and internal nodes (nodes with two children) correspond to the operators. In this problem, we only consider the `'+'` operator (i.e. addition).\n\nYou are given the roots of two binary expression trees, `root1` and `root2`. Return `true` _if the two binary expression trees are equivalent_. Otherwise, return `false`.\n\nTwo binary expression trees are equivalent if they **evaluate to the same value** regardless of what the variables are set to.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** root1 = \\[x\\], root2 = \\[x\\]\n**Output:** true\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** root1 = \\[+,a,+,null,null,b,c\\], root2 = \\[+,+,a,b,c\\]\n**Output:** true\n**Explaination:** `a + (b + c) == (b + c) + a`\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** root1 = \\[+,a,+,null,null,b,c\\], root2 = \\[+,+,a,b,d\\]\n**Output:** false\n**Explaination:** `a + (b + c) != (b + d) + a`\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   The number of nodes in both trees are equal, odd and, in the range `[1, 4999]`.\n*   `Node.val` is `'+'` or a lower-case English letter.\n*   It's **guaranteed** that the tree given is a valid binary expression tree.\n\n**Follow up:** What will you change in your solution if the tree also supports the `'-'` operator (i.e. subtraction)?",
