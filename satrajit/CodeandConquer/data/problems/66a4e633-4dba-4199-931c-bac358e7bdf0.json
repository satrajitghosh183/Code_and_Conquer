  "description": "You are given the `head` of a linked list, which contains a series of integers **separated** by `0`'s. The **beginning** and **end** of the linked list will have `Node.val == 0`.\n\nFor **every** two consecutive `0`'s, **merge** all the nodes lying in between them into a single node whose value is the **sum** of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any `0`'s.\n\nReturn _the_ `head` _of the modified linked list_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** head = \\[0,3,1,0,4,5,2,0\\]\n**Output:** \\[4,11\\]\n**Explanation:** \nThe above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains\n- The sum of the nodes marked in green: 3 + 1 = 4.\n- The sum of the nodes marked in red: 4 + 5 + 2 = 11.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** head = \\[0,1,0,3,0,2,2,0\\]\n**Output:** \\[1,3,4\\]\n**Explanation:** \nThe above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains\n- The sum of the nodes marked in green: 1 = 1.\n- The sum of the nodes marked in red: 3 = 3.\n- The sum of the nodes marked in yellow: 2 + 2 = 4.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[3, 2 * 105]`.\n*   `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`\n*   There are **no** two consecutive nodes with `Node.val == 0`.\n*   The **beginning** and **end** of the linked list have `Node.val == 0`.",
