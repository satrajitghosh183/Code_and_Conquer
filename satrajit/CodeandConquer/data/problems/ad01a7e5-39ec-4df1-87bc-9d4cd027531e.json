  "title": "Maximum XOR of Two Non-Overlapping Subtrees",
  "slug": "maximum-xor-of-two-non-overlapping-subtrees",
  "description": "There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given the integer `n` and a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree. The root of the tree is the node labeled `0`.\n\nEach node has an associated **value**. You are given an array `values` of length `n`, where `values[i]` is the **value** of the `ith` node.\n\nSelect any two **non-overlapping** subtrees. Your **score** is the bitwise XOR of the sum of the values within those subtrees.\n\nReturn _the_ _**maximum**_ _possible **score** you can achieve_. _If it is impossible to find two nonoverlapping subtrees_, return `0`.\n\n**Note** that:\n\n*   The **subtree** of a node is the tree consisting of that node and all of its descendants.\n*   Two subtrees are **non-overlapping** if they do not share **any common** node.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 6, edges = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[0,2\\],\\[1,3\\],\\[1,4\\],\\[2,5\\]\\], values = \\[2,8,3,6,2,5\\]\n**Output:** 24\n**Explanation:** Node 1's subtree has sum of values 16, while node 2's subtree has sum of values 8, so choosing these nodes will yield a score of 16 XOR 8 = 24. It can be proved that is the maximum possible score we can obtain.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 3, edges = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[1,2\\]\\], values = \\[4,6,1\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** There is no possible way to select two non-overlapping subtrees, so we just return 0.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= n <= 5 * 104`\n*   `edges.length == n - 1`\n*   `0 <= ai, bi < n`\n*   `values.length == n`\n*   `1 <= values[i] <= 109`\n*   It is guaranteed that `edges` represents a valid tree.",
