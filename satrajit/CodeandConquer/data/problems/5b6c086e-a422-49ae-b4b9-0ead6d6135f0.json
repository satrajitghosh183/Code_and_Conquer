  "slug": "find-closest-node-to-given-two-nodes",
  "description": "You are given a **directed** graph of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, where each node has **at most one** outgoing edge.\n\nThe graph is represented with a given **0-indexed** array `edges` of size `n`, indicating that there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `edges[i]`. If there is no outgoing edge from `i`, then `edges[i] == -1`.\n\nYou are also given two integers `node1` and `node2`.\n\nReturn _the **index** of the node that can be reached from both_ `node1` _and_ `node2`_, such that the **maximum** between the distance from_ `node1` _to that node, and from_ `node2` _to that node is **minimized**_. If there are multiple answers, return the node with the **smallest** index, and if no possible answer exists, return `-1`.\n\nNote that `edges` may contain cycles.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** edges = \\[2,2,3,-1\\], node1 = 0, node2 = 1\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** The distance from node 0 to node 2 is 1, and the distance from node 1 to node 2 is 1.\nThe maximum of those two distances is 1. It can be proven that we cannot get a node with a smaller maximum distance than 1, so we return node 2.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** edges = \\[1,2,-1\\], node1 = 0, node2 = 2\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** The distance from node 0 to node 2 is 2, and the distance from node 2 to itself is 0.\nThe maximum of those two distances is 2. It can be proven that we cannot get a node with a smaller maximum distance than 2, so we return node 2.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == edges.length`\n*   `2 <= n <= 105`\n*   `-1 <= edges[i] < n`\n*   `edges[i] != i`\n*   `0 <= node1, node2 < n`",
