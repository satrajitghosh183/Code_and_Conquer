  "description": "You are given a binary string `binary`. A **subsequence** of `binary` is considered **good** if it is **not empty** and has **no leading zeros** (with the exception of `\"0 \"`).\n\nFind the number of **unique good subsequences** of `binary`.\n\n*   For example, if `binary = \"001 \"`, then all the **good** subsequences are `[ \"0 \", \"0 \", \"1 \"]`, so the **unique** good subsequences are `\"0 \"` and `\"1 \"`. Note that subsequences `\"00 \"`, `\"01 \"`, and `\"001 \"` are not good because they have leading zeros.\n\nReturn _the number of **unique good subsequences** of_ `binary`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.\n\nA **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** binary =  \"001 \"\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** The good subsequences of binary are \\[ \"0 \",  \"0 \",  \"1 \"\\].\nThe unique good subsequences are  \"0 \" and  \"1 \".\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** binary =  \"11 \"\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** The good subsequences of binary are \\[ \"1 \",  \"1 \",  \"11 \"\\].\nThe unique good subsequences are  \"1 \" and  \"11 \".\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** binary =  \"101 \"\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** The good subsequences of binary are \\[ \"1 \",  \"0 \",  \"1 \",  \"10 \",  \"11 \",  \"101 \"\\]. \nThe unique good subsequences are  \"0 \",  \"1 \",  \"10 \",  \"11 \", and  \"101 \".\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= binary.length <= 105`\n*   `binary` consists of only `'0'`s and `'1'`s.",
