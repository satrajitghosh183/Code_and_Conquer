  "description": "There is a garden of `n` flowers, and each flower has an integer beauty value. The flowers are arranged in a line. You are given an integer array `flowers` of size `n` and each `flowers[i]` represents the beauty of the `ith` flower.\n\nA garden is **valid** if it meets these conditions:\n\n*   The garden has at least two flowers.\n*   The first and the last flower of the garden have the same beauty value.\n\nAs the appointed gardener, you have the ability to **remove** any (possibly none) flowers from the garden. You want to remove flowers in a way that makes the remaining garden **valid**. The beauty of the garden is the sum of the beauty of all the remaining flowers.\n\nReturn the maximum possible beauty of some **valid** garden after you have removed any (possibly none) flowers.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** flowers = \\[1,2,3,1,2\\]\n**Output:** 8\n**Explanation:** You can produce the valid garden \\[2,3,1,2\\] to have a total beauty of 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 8.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** flowers = \\[100,1,1,-3,1\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** You can produce the valid garden \\[1,1,1\\] to have a total beauty of 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** flowers = \\[-1,-2,0,-1\\]\n**Output:** -2\n**Explanation:** You can produce the valid garden \\[-1,-1\\] to have a total beauty of -1 + -1 = -2.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= flowers.length <= 105`\n*   `-104 <= flowers[i] <= 104`\n*   It is possible to create a valid garden by removing some (possibly none) flowers.",
