  "description": "Given an integer `n` and an integer array `rounds`. We have a circular track which consists of `n` sectors labeled from `1` to `n`. A marathon will be held on this track, the marathon consists of `m` rounds. The `ith` round starts at sector `rounds[i - 1]` and ends at sector `rounds[i]`. For example, round 1 starts at sector `rounds[0]` and ends at sector `rounds[1]`\n\nReturn _an array of the most visited sectors_ sorted in **ascending** order.\n\nNotice that you circulate the track in ascending order of sector numbers in the counter-clockwise direction (See the first example).\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 4, rounds = \\[1,3,1,2\\]\n**Output:** \\[1,2\\]\n**Explanation:** The marathon starts at sector 1. The order of the visited sectors is as follows:\n1 --> 2 --> 3 (end of round 1) --> 4 --> 1 (end of round 2) --> 2 (end of round 3 and the marathon)\nWe can see that both sectors 1 and 2 are visited twice and they are the most visited sectors. Sectors 3 and 4 are visited only once.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 2, rounds = \\[2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2\\]\n**Output:** \\[2\\]\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** n = 7, rounds = \\[1,3,5,7\\]\n**Output:** \\[1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\]\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= n <= 100`\n*   `1 <= m <= 100`\n*   `rounds.length == m + 1`\n*   `1 <= rounds[i] <= n`\n*   `rounds[i] != rounds[i + 1]` for `0 <= i < m`",
