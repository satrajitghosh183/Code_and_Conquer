  "description": "There is a test that has `n` types of questions. You are given an integer `target` and a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `types` where `types[i] = [counti, marksi]` indicates that there are `counti` questions of the `ith` type, and each one of them is worth `marksi` points.\n\nReturn _the number of ways you can earn **exactly**_ `target` _points in the exam_. Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.\n\n**Note** that questions of the same type are indistinguishable.\n\n*   For example, if there are `3` questions of the same type, then solving the `1st` and `2nd` questions is the same as solving the `1st` and `3rd` questions, or the `2nd` and `3rd` questions.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** target = 6, types = \\[\\[6,1\\],\\[3,2\\],\\[2,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** 7\n**Explanation:** You can earn 6 points in one of the seven ways:\n- Solve 6 questions of the 0th type: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6\n- Solve 4 questions of the 0th type and 1 question of the 1st type: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6\n- Solve 2 questions of the 0th type and 2 questions of the 1st type: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6\n- Solve 3 questions of the 0th type and 1 question of the 2nd type: 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 6\n- Solve 1 question of the 0th type, 1 question of the 1st type and 1 question of the 2nd type: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6\n- Solve 3 questions of the 1st type: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6\n- Solve 2 questions of the 2nd type: 3 + 3 = 6\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** target = 5, types = \\[\\[50,1\\],\\[50,2\\],\\[50,5\\]\\]\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** You can earn 5 points in one of the four ways:\n- Solve 5 questions of the 0th type: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5\n- Solve 3 questions of the 0th type and 1 question of the 1st type: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5\n- Solve 1 questions of the 0th type and 2 questions of the 1st type: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5\n- Solve 1 question of the 2nd type: 5\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** target = 18, types = \\[\\[6,1\\],\\[3,2\\],\\[2,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** You can only earn 18 points by answering all questions.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= target <= 1000`\n*   `n == types.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 50`\n*   `types[i].length == 2`\n*   `1 <= counti, marksi <= 50`",
