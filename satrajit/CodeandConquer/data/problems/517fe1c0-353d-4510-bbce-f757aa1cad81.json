  "description": "You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums` and `removeQueries`, both of length `n`. For the `ith` query, the element in `nums` at the index `removeQueries[i]` is removed, splitting `nums` into different segments.\n\nA **segment** is a contiguous sequence of **positive** integers in `nums`. A **segment sum** is the sum of every element in a segment.\n\nReturn _an integer array_ `answer`_, of length_ `n`_, where_ `answer[i]` _is the **maximum** segment sum after applying the_ `ith` _removal._\n\n**Note:** The same index will **not** be removed more than once.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[1,2,5,6,1\\], removeQueries = \\[0,3,2,4,1\\]\n**Output:** \\[14,7,2,2,0\\]\n**Explanation:** Using 0 to indicate a removed element, the answer is as follows:\nQuery 1: Remove the 0th element, nums becomes \\[0,2,5,6,1\\] and the maximum segment sum is 14 for segment \\[2,5,6,1\\].\nQuery 2: Remove the 3rd element, nums becomes \\[0,2,5,0,1\\] and the maximum segment sum is 7 for segment \\[2,5\\].\nQuery 3: Remove the 2nd element, nums becomes \\[0,2,0,0,1\\] and the maximum segment sum is 2 for segment \\[2\\]. \nQuery 4: Remove the 4th element, nums becomes \\[0,2,0,0,0\\] and the maximum segment sum is 2 for segment \\[2\\]. \nQuery 5: Remove the 1st element, nums becomes \\[0,0,0,0,0\\] and the maximum segment sum is 0, since there are no segments.\nFinally, we return \\[14,7,2,2,0\\].\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[3,2,11,1\\], removeQueries = \\[3,2,1,0\\]\n**Output:** \\[16,5,3,0\\]\n**Explanation:** Using 0 to indicate a removed element, the answer is as follows:\nQuery 1: Remove the 3rd element, nums becomes \\[3,2,11,0\\] and the maximum segment sum is 16 for segment \\[3,2,11\\].\nQuery 2: Remove the 2nd element, nums becomes \\[3,2,0,0\\] and the maximum segment sum is 5 for segment \\[3,2\\].\nQuery 3: Remove the 1st element, nums becomes \\[3,0,0,0\\] and the maximum segment sum is 3 for segment \\[3\\].\nQuery 4: Remove the 0th element, nums becomes \\[0,0,0,0\\] and the maximum segment sum is 0, since there are no segments.\nFinally, we return \\[16,5,3,0\\].\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == nums.length == removeQueries.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 105`\n*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`\n*   `0 <= removeQueries[i] < n`\n*   All the values of `removeQueries` are **unique**.",
