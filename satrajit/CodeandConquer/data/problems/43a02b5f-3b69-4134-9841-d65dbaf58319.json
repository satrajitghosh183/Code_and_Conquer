  "description": "Given an integer `n`, you must transform it into `0` using the following operations any number of times:\n\n*   Change the rightmost (`0th`) bit in the binary representation of `n`.\n*   Change the `ith` bit in the binary representation of `n` if the `(i-1)th` bit is set to `1` and the `(i-2)th` through `0th` bits are set to `0`.\n\nReturn _the minimum number of operations to transform_ `n` _into_ `0`_._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 3\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** The binary representation of 3 is  \"11 \".\n \"11 \" ->  \"01 \" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.\n \"01 \" ->  \"00 \" with the 1st operation.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 6\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** The binary representation of 6 is  \"110 \".\n \"110 \" ->  \"010 \" with the 2nd operation since the 1st bit is 1 and 0th through 0th bits are 0.\n \"010 \" ->  \"011 \" with the 1st operation.\n \"011 \" ->  \"001 \" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.\n \"001 \" ->  \"000 \" with the 1st operation.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `0 <= n <= 109`",
