  "description": "A **good meal** is a meal that contains **exactly two different food items** with a sum of deliciousness equal to a power of two.\n\nYou can pick **any** two different foods to make a good meal.\n\nGiven an array of integers `deliciousness` where `deliciousness[i]` is the deliciousness of the `i​​​​​​th​​​​`​​​​ item of food, return _the number of different **good meals** you can make from this list modulo_ `109 + 7`.\n\nNote that items with different indices are considered different even if they have the same deliciousness value.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** deliciousness = \\[1,3,5,7,9\\]\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** The good meals are (1,3), (1,7), (3,5) and, (7,9).\nTheir respective sums are 4, 8, 8, and 16, all of which are powers of 2.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** deliciousness = \\[1,1,1,3,3,3,7\\]\n**Output:** 15\n**Explanation:** The good meals are (1,1) with 3 ways, (1,3) with 9 ways, and (1,7) with 3 ways.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= deliciousness.length <= 105`\n*   `0 <= deliciousness[i] <= 220`",
