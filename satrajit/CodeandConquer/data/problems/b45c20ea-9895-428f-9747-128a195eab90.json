  "description": "You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given `heights`, a 2D array of size `rows x columns`, where `heights[row][col]` represents the height of cell `(row, col)`. You are situated in the top-left cell, `(0, 0)`, and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, `(rows-1, columns-1)` (i.e., **0-indexed**). You can move **up**, **down**, **left**, or **right**, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum **effort**.\n\nA route's **effort** is the **maximum absolute difference** in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.\n\nReturn _the minimum **effort** required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** heights = \\[\\[1,2,2\\],\\[3,8,2\\],\\[5,3,5\\]\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** The route of \\[1,3,5,3,5\\] has a maximum absolute difference of 2 in consecutive cells.\nThis is better than the route of \\[1,2,2,2,5\\], where the maximum absolute difference is 3.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** heights = \\[\\[1,2,3\\],\\[3,8,4\\],\\[5,3,5\\]\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** The route of \\[1,2,3,4,5\\] has a maximum absolute difference of 1 in consecutive cells, which is better than route \\[1,3,5,3,5\\].\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** heights = \\[\\[1,2,1,1,1\\],\\[1,2,1,2,1\\],\\[1,2,1,2,1\\],\\[1,2,1,2,1\\],\\[1,1,1,2,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** This route does not require any effort.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `rows == heights.length`\n*   `columns == heights[i].length`\n*   `1 <= rows, columns <= 100`\n*   `1 <= heights[i][j] <= 106`",
