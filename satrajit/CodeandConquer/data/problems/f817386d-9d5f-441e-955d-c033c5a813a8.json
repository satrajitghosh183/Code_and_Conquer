  "slug": "smallest-k-length-subsequence-with-occurrences-of-a-letter",
  "description": "You are given a string `s`, an integer `k`, a letter `letter`, and an integer `repetition`.\n\nReturn _the **lexicographically smallest** subsequence of_ `s` _of length_ `k` _that has the letter_ `letter` _appear **at least**_ `repetition` _times_. The test cases are generated so that the `letter` appears in `s` **at least** `repetition` times.\n\nA **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.\n\nA string `a` is **lexicographically smaller** than a string `b` if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, string `a` has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in `b`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"leet \", k = 3, letter =  \"e \", repetition = 1\n**Output:**  \"eet \"\n**Explanation:** There are four subsequences of length 3 that have the letter 'e' appear at least 1 time:\n-  \"lee \" (from  \"**lee**t \")\n-  \"let \" (from  \"**le**e**t** \")\n-  \"let \" (from  \"**l**e**et** \")\n-  \"eet \" (from  \"l**eet** \")\nThe lexicographically smallest subsequence among them is  \"eet \".\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"leetcode \", k = 4, letter =  \"e \", repetition = 2\n**Output:**  \"ecde \"\n**Explanation:**  \"ecde \" is the lexicographically smallest subsequence of length 4 that has the letter  \"e \" appear at least 2 times.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"bb \", k = 2, letter =  \"b \", repetition = 2\n**Output:**  \"bb \"\n**Explanation:**  \"bb \" is the only subsequence of length 2 that has the letter  \"b \" appear at least 2 times.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= repetition <= k <= s.length <= 5 * 104`\n*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters.\n*   `letter` is a lowercase English letter, and appears in `s` at least `repetition` times.",
