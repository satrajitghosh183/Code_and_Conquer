  "description": "You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You may partition `nums` into one or more **subsequences** such that each element in `nums` appears in **exactly** one of the subsequences.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** number of subsequences needed such that the difference between the maximum and minimum values in each subsequence is **at most**_ `k`_._\n\nA **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[3,6,1,2,5\\], k = 2\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:**\nWe can partition nums into the two subsequences \\[3,1,2\\] and \\[6,5\\].\nThe difference between the maximum and minimum value in the first subsequence is 3 - 1 = 2.\nThe difference between the maximum and minimum value in the second subsequence is 6 - 5 = 1.\nSince two subsequences were created, we return 2. It can be shown that 2 is the minimum number of subsequences needed.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[1,2,3\\], k = 1\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:**\nWe can partition nums into the two subsequences \\[1,2\\] and \\[3\\].\nThe difference between the maximum and minimum value in the first subsequence is 2 - 1 = 1.\nThe difference between the maximum and minimum value in the second subsequence is 3 - 3 = 0.\nSince two subsequences were created, we return 2. Note that another optimal solution is to partition nums into the two subsequences \\[1\\] and \\[2,3\\].\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[2,2,4,5\\], k = 0\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:**\nWe can partition nums into the three subsequences \\[2,2\\], \\[4\\], and \\[5\\].\nThe difference between the maximum and minimum value in the first subsequences is 2 - 2 = 0.\nThe difference between the maximum and minimum value in the second subsequences is 4 - 4 = 0.\nThe difference between the maximum and minimum value in the third subsequences is 5 - 5 = 0.\nSince three subsequences were created, we return 3. It can be shown that 3 is the minimum number of subsequences needed.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`\n*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 105`\n*   `0 <= k <= 105`",
