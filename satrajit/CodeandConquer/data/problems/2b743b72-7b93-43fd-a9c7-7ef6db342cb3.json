  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `tasks`, where `tasks[i]` represents the difficulty level of a task. In each round, you can complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the **same difficulty level**.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** rounds required to complete all the tasks, or_ `-1` _if it is not possible to complete all the tasks._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** tasks = \\[2,2,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4\\]\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** To complete all the tasks, a possible plan is:\n- In the first round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 2. \n- In the second round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 3. \n- In the third round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 4. \n- In the fourth round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 4.  \nIt can be shown that all the tasks cannot be completed in fewer than 4 rounds, so the answer is 4.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** tasks = \\[2,3,3\\]\n**Output:** -1\n**Explanation:** There is only 1 task of difficulty level 2, but in each round, you can only complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the same difficulty level. Hence, you cannot complete all the tasks, and the answer is -1.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= tasks.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= tasks[i] <= 109`",
