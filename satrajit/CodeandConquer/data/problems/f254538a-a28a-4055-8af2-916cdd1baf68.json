  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** array of positive integers `tasks`, representing tasks that need to be completed **in order**, where `tasks[i]` represents the **type** of the `ith` task.\n\nYou are also given a positive integer `space`, which represents the **minimum** number of days that must pass **after** the completion of a task before another task of the **same** type can be performed.\n\nEach day, until all tasks have been completed, you must either:\n\n*   Complete the next task from `tasks`, or\n*   Take a break.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** number of days needed to complete all tasks_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** tasks = \\[1,2,1,2,3,1\\], space = 3\n**Output:** 9\n**Explanation:**\nOne way to complete all tasks in 9 days is as follows:\nDay 1: Complete the 0th task.\nDay 2: Complete the 1st task.\nDay 3: Take a break.\nDay 4: Take a break.\nDay 5: Complete the 2nd task.\nDay 6: Complete the 3rd task.\nDay 7: Take a break.\nDay 8: Complete the 4th task.\nDay 9: Complete the 5th task.\nIt can be shown that the tasks cannot be completed in less than 9 days.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** tasks = \\[5,8,8,5\\], space = 2\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:**\nOne way to complete all tasks in 6 days is as follows:\nDay 1: Complete the 0th task.\nDay 2: Complete the 1st task.\nDay 3: Take a break.\nDay 4: Take a break.\nDay 5: Complete the 2nd task.\nDay 6: Complete the 3rd task.\nIt can be shown that the tasks cannot be completed in less than 6 days.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= tasks.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= tasks[i] <= 109`\n*   `1 <= space <= tasks.length`",
