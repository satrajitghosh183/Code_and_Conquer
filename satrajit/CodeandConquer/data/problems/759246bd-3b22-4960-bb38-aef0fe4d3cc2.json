  "description": "There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.\n\nYou are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n` where `nums[i]` represents the value of the `ith` node. You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree.\n\nYou are allowed to **delete** some edges, splitting the tree into multiple connected components. Let the **value** of a component be the sum of **all** `nums[i]` for which node `i` is in the component.\n\nReturn _the **maximum** number of edges you can delete, such that every connected component in the tree has the same value._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[6,2,2,2,6\\], edges = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[1,3\\],\\[3,4\\]\\] \n**Output:** 2 \n**Explanation:** The above figure shows how we can delete the edges \\[0,1\\] and \\[3,4\\]. The created components are nodes \\[0\\], \\[1,2,3\\] and \\[4\\]. The sum of the values in each component equals 6. It can be proven that no better deletion exists, so the answer is 2.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[2\\], edges = \\[\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** There are no edges to be deleted.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`\n*   `nums.length == n`\n*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 50`\n*   `edges.length == n - 1`\n*   `edges[i].length == 2`\n*   `0 <= edges[i][0], edges[i][1] <= n - 1`\n*   `edges` represents a valid tree.",
