  "description": "You are given a positive integer array `skill` of **even** length `n` where `skill[i]` denotes the skill of the `ith` player. Divide the players into `n / 2` teams of size `2` such that the total skill of each team is **equal**.\n\nThe **chemistry** of a team is equal to the **product** of the skills of the players on that team.\n\nReturn _the sum of the **chemistry** of all the teams, or return_ `-1` _if there is no way to divide the players into teams such that the total skill of each team is equal._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** skill = \\[3,2,5,1,3,4\\]\n**Output:** 22\n**Explanation:** \nDivide the players into the following teams: (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), where each team has a total skill of 6.\nThe sum of the chemistry of all the teams is: 1 \\* 5 + 2 \\* 4 + 3 \\* 3 = 5 + 8 + 9 = 22.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** skill = \\[3,4\\]\n**Output:** 12\n**Explanation:** \nThe two players form a team with a total skill of 7.\nThe chemistry of the team is 3 \\* 4 = 12.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** skill = \\[1,1,2,3\\]\n**Output:** -1\n**Explanation:** \nThere is no way to divide the players into teams such that the total skill of each team is equal.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= skill.length <= 105`\n*   `skill.length` is even.\n*   `1 <= skill[i] <= 1000`",
