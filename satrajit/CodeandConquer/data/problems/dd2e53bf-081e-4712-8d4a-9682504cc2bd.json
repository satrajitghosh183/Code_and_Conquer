  "description": "Given four integers `length`, `width`, `height`, and `mass`, representing the dimensions and mass of a box, respectively, return _a string representing the **category** of the box_.\n\n*   The box is `\"Bulky \"` if:\n    *   **Any** of the dimensions of the box is greater or equal to `104`.\n    *   Or, the **volume** of the box is greater or equal to `109`.\n*   If the mass of the box is greater or equal to `100`, it is `\"Heavy \".`\n*   If the box is both `\"Bulky \"` and `\"Heavy \"`, then its category is `\"Both \"`.\n*   If the box is neither `\"Bulky \"` nor `\"Heavy \"`, then its category is `\"Neither \"`.\n*   If the box is `\"Bulky \"` but not `\"Heavy \"`, then its category is `\"Bulky \"`.\n*   If the box is `\"Heavy \"` but not `\"Bulky \"`, then its category is `\"Heavy \"`.\n\n**Note** that the volume of the box is the product of its length, width and height.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** length = 1000, width = 35, height = 700, mass = 300\n**Output:**  \"Heavy \"\n**Explanation:** \nNone of the dimensions of the box is greater or equal to 104. \nIts volume = 24500000 <= 109. So it cannot be categorized as  \"Bulky \".\nHowever mass >= 100, so the box is  \"Heavy \".\nSince the box is not  \"Bulky \" but  \"Heavy \", we return  \"Heavy \".\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** length = 200, width = 50, height = 800, mass = 50\n**Output:**  \"Neither \"\n**Explanation:** \nNone of the dimensions of the box is greater or equal to 104.\nIts volume = 8 \\* 106 <= 109. So it cannot be categorized as  \"Bulky \".\nIts mass is also less than 100, so it cannot be categorized as  \"Heavy \" either. \nSince its neither of the two above categories, we return  \"Neither \".\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= length, width, height <= 105`\n*   `1 <= mass <= 103`",
