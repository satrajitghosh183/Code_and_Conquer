  "description": "As the ruler of a kingdom, you have an army of wizards at your command.\n\nYou are given a **0-indexed** integer array `strength`, where `strength[i]` denotes the strength of the `ith` wizard. For a **contiguous** group of wizards (i.e. the wizards' strengths form a **subarray** of `strength`), the **total strength** is defined as the **product** of the following two values:\n\n*   The strength of the **weakest** wizard in the group.\n*   The **total** of all the individual strengths of the wizards in the group.\n\nReturn _the **sum** of the total strengths of **all** contiguous groups of wizards_. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.\n\nA **subarray** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of elements within an array.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** strength = \\[1,3,1,2\\]\n**Output:** 44\n**Explanation:** The following are all the contiguous groups of wizards:\n- \\[1\\] from \\[**1**,3,1,2\\] has a total strength of min(\\[1\\]) \\* sum(\\[1\\]) = 1 \\* 1 = 1\n- \\[3\\] from \\[1,**3**,1,2\\] has a total strength of min(\\[3\\]) \\* sum(\\[3\\]) = 3 \\* 3 = 9\n- \\[1\\] from \\[1,3,**1**,2\\] has a total strength of min(\\[1\\]) \\* sum(\\[1\\]) = 1 \\* 1 = 1\n- \\[2\\] from \\[1,3,1,**2**\\] has a total strength of min(\\[2\\]) \\* sum(\\[2\\]) = 2 \\* 2 = 4\n- \\[1,3\\] from \\[**1,3**,1,2\\] has a total strength of min(\\[1,3\\]) \\* sum(\\[1,3\\]) = 1 \\* 4 = 4\n- \\[3,1\\] from \\[1,**3,1**,2\\] has a total strength of min(\\[3,1\\]) \\* sum(\\[3,1\\]) = 1 \\* 4 = 4\n- \\[1,2\\] from \\[1,3,**1,2**\\] has a total strength of min(\\[1,2\\]) \\* sum(\\[1,2\\]) = 1 \\* 3 = 3\n- \\[1,3,1\\] from \\[**1,3,1**,2\\] has a total strength of min(\\[1,3,1\\]) \\* sum(\\[1,3,1\\]) = 1 \\* 5 = 5\n- \\[3,1,2\\] from \\[1,**3,1,2**\\] has a total strength of min(\\[3,1,2\\]) \\* sum(\\[3,1,2\\]) = 1 \\* 6 = 6\n- \\[1,3,1,2\\] from \\[**1,3,1,2**\\] has a total strength of min(\\[1,3,1,2\\]) \\* sum(\\[1,3,1,2\\]) = 1 \\* 7 = 7\nThe sum of all the total strengths is 1 + 9 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 44.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** strength = \\[5,4,6\\]\n**Output:** 213\n**Explanation:** The following are all the contiguous groups of wizards: \n- \\[5\\] from \\[**5**,4,6\\] has a total strength of min(\\[5\\]) \\* sum(\\[5\\]) = 5 \\* 5 = 25\n- \\[4\\] from \\[5,**4**,6\\] has a total strength of min(\\[4\\]) \\* sum(\\[4\\]) = 4 \\* 4 = 16\n- \\[6\\] from \\[5,4,**6**\\] has a total strength of min(\\[6\\]) \\* sum(\\[6\\]) = 6 \\* 6 = 36\n- \\[5,4\\] from \\[**5,4**,6\\] has a total strength of min(\\[5,4\\]) \\* sum(\\[5,4\\]) = 4 \\* 9 = 36\n- \\[4,6\\] from \\[5,**4,6**\\] has a total strength of min(\\[4,6\\]) \\* sum(\\[4,6\\]) = 4 \\* 10 = 40\n- \\[5,4,6\\] from \\[**5,4,6**\\] has a total strength of min(\\[5,4,6\\]) \\* sum(\\[5,4,6\\]) = 4 \\* 15 = 60\nThe sum of all the total strengths is 25 + 16 + 36 + 36 + 40 + 60 = 213.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= strength.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= strength[i] <= 109`",
