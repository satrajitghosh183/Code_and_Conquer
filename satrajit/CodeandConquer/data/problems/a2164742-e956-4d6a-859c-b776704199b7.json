  "description": "You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`, where you can move from a cell to any adjacent cell in all `4` directions.\n\nReturn _the number of **strictly** **increasing** paths in the grid such that you can start from **any** cell and end at **any** cell._ Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.\n\nTwo paths are considered different if they do not have exactly the same sequence of visited cells.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[1,1\\],\\[3,4\\]\\]\n**Output:** 8\n**Explanation:** The strictly increasing paths are:\n- Paths with length 1: \\[1\\], \\[1\\], \\[3\\], \\[4\\].\n- Paths with length 2: \\[1 -> 3\\], \\[1 -> 4\\], \\[3 -> 4\\].\n- Paths with length 3: \\[1 -> 3 -> 4\\].\nThe total number of paths is 4 + 3 + 1 = 8.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[1\\],\\[2\\]\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** The strictly increasing paths are:\n- Paths with length 1: \\[1\\], \\[2\\].\n- Paths with length 2: \\[1 -> 2\\].\nThe total number of paths is 2 + 1 = 3.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `m == grid.length`\n*   `n == grid[i].length`\n*   `1 <= m, n <= 1000`\n*   `1 <= m * n <= 105`\n*   `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 105`",
