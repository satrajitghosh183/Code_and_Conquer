  "slug": "find-all-lonely-numbers-in-the-array",
  "description": "You are given an integer array `nums`. A number `x` is **lonely** when it appears only **once**, and no **adjacent** numbers (i.e. `x + 1` and `x - 1)` appear in the array.\n\nReturn _**all** lonely numbers in_ `nums`. You may return the answer in **any order**.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[10,6,5,8\\]\n**Output:** \\[10,8\\]\n**Explanation:** \n- 10 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 9 and 11 does not appear in nums.\n- 8 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 7 and 9 does not appear in nums.\n- 5 is not a lonely number since 6 appears in nums and vice versa.\nHence, the lonely numbers in nums are \\[10, 8\\].\nNote that \\[8, 10\\] may also be returned.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[1,3,5,3\\]\n**Output:** \\[1,5\\]\n**Explanation:** \n- 1 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 0 and 2 does not appear in nums.\n- 5 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 4 and 6 does not appear in nums.\n- 3 is not a lonely number since it appears twice.\nHence, the lonely numbers in nums are \\[1, 5\\].\nNote that \\[5, 1\\] may also be returned.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`\n*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 106`",
