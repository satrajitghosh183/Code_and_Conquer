  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `forts` of length `n` representing the positions of several forts. `forts[i]` can be `-1`, `0`, or `1` where:\n\n*   `-1` represents there is **no fort** at the `ith` position.\n*   `0` indicates there is an **enemy** fort at the `ith` position.\n*   `1` indicates the fort at the `ith` the position is under your command.\n\nNow you have decided to move your army from one of your forts at position `i` to an empty position `j` such that:\n\n*   `0 <= i, j <= n - 1`\n*   The army travels over enemy forts **only**. Formally, for all `k` where `min(i,j) < k < max(i,j)`, `forts[k] == 0.`\n\nWhile moving the army, all the enemy forts that come in the way are **captured**.\n\nReturn _the **maximum** number of enemy forts that can be captured_. In case it is **impossible** to move your army, or you do not have any fort under your command, return `0`_._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** forts = \\[1,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,1\\]\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:**\n- Moving the army from position 0 to position 3 captures 2 enemy forts, at 1 and 2.\n- Moving the army from position 8 to position 3 captures 4 enemy forts.\nSince 4 is the maximum number of enemy forts that can be captured, we return 4.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** forts = \\[0,0,1,-1\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** Since no enemy fort can be captured, 0 is returned.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= forts.length <= 1000`\n*   `-1 <= forts[i] <= 1`",
