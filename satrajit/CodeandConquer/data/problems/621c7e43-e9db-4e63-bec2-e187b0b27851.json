  "description": "You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, and an integer array `queries` of length `m`.\n\nReturn _an array_ `answer` _of length_ `m` _where_ `answer[i]` _is the **maximum** size of a **subsequence** that you can take from_ `nums` _such that the **sum** of its elements is less than or equal to_ `queries[i]`.\n\nA **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[4,5,2,1\\], queries = \\[3,10,21\\]\n**Output:** \\[2,3,4\\]\n**Explanation:** We answer the queries as follows:\n- The subsequence \\[2,1\\] has a sum less than or equal to 3. It can be proven that 2 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer\\[0\\] = 2.\n- The subsequence \\[4,5,1\\] has a sum less than or equal to 10. It can be proven that 3 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer\\[1\\] = 3.\n- The subsequence \\[4,5,2,1\\] has a sum less than or equal to 21. It can be proven that 4 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer\\[2\\] = 4.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[2,3,4,5\\], queries = \\[1\\]\n**Output:** \\[0\\]\n**Explanation:** The empty subsequence is the only subsequence that has a sum less than or equal to 1, so answer\\[0\\] = 0.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == nums.length`\n*   `m == queries.length`\n*   `1 <= n, m <= 1000`\n*   `1 <= nums[i], queries[i] <= 106`",
