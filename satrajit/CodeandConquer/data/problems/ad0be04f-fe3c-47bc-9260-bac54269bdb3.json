  "description": "You are given a directed graph with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, where each node has **exactly one** outgoing edge.\n\nThe graph is represented by a given **0-indexed** integer array `edges` of length `n`, where `edges[i]` indicates that there is a **directed** edge from node `i` to node `edges[i]`.\n\nThe **edge score** of a node `i` is defined as the sum of the **labels** of all the nodes that have an edge pointing to `i`.\n\nReturn _the node with the highest **edge score**_. If multiple nodes have the same **edge score**, return the node with the **smallest** index.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** edges = \\[1,0,0,0,0,7,7,5\\]\n**Output:** 7\n**Explanation:**\n- The nodes 1, 2, 3 and 4 have an edge pointing to node 0. The edge score of node 0 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.\n- The node 0 has an edge pointing to node 1. The edge score of node 1 is 0.\n- The node 7 has an edge pointing to node 5. The edge score of node 5 is 7.\n- The nodes 5 and 6 have an edge pointing to node 7. The edge score of node 7 is 5 + 6 = 11.\nNode 7 has the highest edge score so return 7.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** edges = \\[2,0,0,2\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:**\n- The nodes 1 and 2 have an edge pointing to node 0. The edge score of node 0 is 1 + 2 = 3.\n- The nodes 0 and 3 have an edge pointing to node 2. The edge score of node 2 is 0 + 3 = 3.\nNodes 0 and 2 both have an edge score of 3. Since node 0 has a smaller index, we return 0.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == edges.length`\n*   `2 <= n <= 105`\n*   `0 <= edges[i] < n`\n*   `edges[i] != i`",
