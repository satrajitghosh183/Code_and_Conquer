  "description": "You are given a positive integer **0-indexed** array `nums`.\n\nA subset of the array `nums` is **square-free** if the product of its elements is a **square-free integer**.\n\nA **square-free integer** is an integer that is divisible by no square number other than `1`.\n\nReturn _the number of square-free non-empty subsets of the array_ **nums**. Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.\n\nA **non-empty** **subset** of `nums` is an array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none but not all) elements from `nums`. Two subsets are different if and only if the chosen indices to delete are different.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[3,4,4,5\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** There are 3 square-free subsets in this example:\n- The subset consisting of the 0th element \\[3\\]. The product of its elements is 3, which is a square-free integer.\n- The subset consisting of the 3rd element \\[5\\]. The product of its elements is 5, which is a square-free integer.\n- The subset consisting of 0th and 3rd elements \\[3,5\\]. The product of its elements is 15, which is a square-free integer.\nIt can be proven that there are no more than 3 square-free subsets in the given array.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[1\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** There is 1 square-free subset in this example:\n- The subset consisting of the 0th element \\[1\\]. The product of its elements is 1, which is a square-free integer.\nIt can be proven that there is no more than 1 square-free subset in the given array.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`\n*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 30`",
