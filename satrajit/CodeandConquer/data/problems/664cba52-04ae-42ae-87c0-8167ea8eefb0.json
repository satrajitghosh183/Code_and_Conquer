  "description": "Given an integer array `arr` of **distinct** integers and an integer `k`.\n\nA game will be played between the first two elements of the array (i.e. `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`). In each round of the game, we compare `arr[0]` with `arr[1]`, the larger integer wins and remains at position `0`, and the smaller integer moves to the end of the array. The game ends when an integer wins `k` consecutive rounds.\n\nReturn _the integer which will win the game_.\n\nIt is **guaranteed** that there will be a winner of the game.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** arr = \\[2,1,3,5,4,6,7\\], k = 2\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** Let's see the rounds of the game:\nRound |       arr       | winner | win\\_count\n  1   | \\[2,1,3,5,4,6,7\\] | 2      | 1\n  2   | \\[2,3,5,4,6,7,1\\] | 3      | 1\n  3   | \\[3,5,4,6,7,1,2\\] | 5      | 1\n  4   | \\[5,4,6,7,1,2,3\\] | 5      | 2\nSo we can see that 4 rounds will be played and 5 is the winner because it wins 2 consecutive games.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** arr = \\[3,2,1\\], k = 10\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** 3 will win the first 10 rounds consecutively.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= arr.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= arr[i] <= 106`\n*   `arr` contains **distinct** integers.\n*   `1 <= k <= 109`",
