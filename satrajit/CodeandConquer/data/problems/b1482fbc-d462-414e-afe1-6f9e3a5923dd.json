  "description": "A **critical point** in a linked list is defined as **either** a **local maxima** or a **local minima**.\n\nA node is a **local maxima** if the current node has a value **strictly greater** than the previous node and the next node.\n\nA node is a **local minima** if the current node has a value **strictly smaller** than the previous node and the next node.\n\nNote that a node can only be a local maxima/minima if there exists **both** a previous node and a next node.\n\nGiven a linked list `head`, return _an array of length 2 containing_ `[minDistance, maxDistance]` _where_ `minDistance` _is the **minimum distance** between **any two distinct** critical points and_ `maxDistance` _is the **maximum distance** between **any two distinct** critical points. If there are **fewer** than two critical points, return_ `[-1, -1]`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** head = \\[3,1\\]\n**Output:** \\[-1,-1\\]\n**Explanation:** There are no critical points in \\[3,1\\].\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** head = \\[5,3,1,2,5,1,2\\]\n**Output:** \\[1,3\\]\n**Explanation:** There are three critical points:\n- \\[5,3,**1**,2,5,1,2\\]: The third node is a local minima because 1 is less than 3 and 2.\n- \\[5,3,1,2,**5**,1,2\\]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 5 is greater than 2 and 1.\n- \\[5,3,1,2,5,**1**,2\\]: The sixth node is a local minima because 1 is less than 5 and 2.\nThe minimum distance is between the fifth and the sixth node. minDistance = 6 - 5 = 1.\nThe maximum distance is between the third and the sixth node. maxDistance = 6 - 3 = 3.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** head = \\[1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7\\]\n**Output:** \\[3,3\\]\n**Explanation:** There are two critical points:\n- \\[1,**3**,2,2,3,2,2,2,7\\]: The second node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 1 and 2.\n- \\[1,3,2,2,**3**,2,2,2,7\\]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 2 and 2.\nBoth the minimum and maximum distances are between the second and the fifth node.\nThus, minDistance and maxDistance is 5 - 2 = 3.\nNote that the last node is not considered a local maxima because it does not have a next node.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[2, 105]`.\n*   `1 <= Node.val <= 105`",
