  "title": "Longest Uploaded Prefix",
  "slug": "longest-uploaded-prefix",
  "description": "You are given a stream of `n` videos, each represented by a **distinct** number from `1` to `n` that you need to \"upload \" to a server. You need to implement a data structure that calculates the length of the **longest uploaded prefix** at various points in the upload process.\n\nWe consider `i` to be an uploaded prefix if all videos in the range `1` to `i` (**inclusive**) have been uploaded to the server. The longest uploaded prefix is the **maximum** value of `i` that satisfies this definition.  \n  \nImplement the `LUPrefix` class:\n\n*   `LUPrefix(int n)` Initializes the object for a stream of `n` videos.\n*   `void upload(int video)` Uploads `video` to the server.\n*   `int longest()` Returns the length of the **longest uploaded prefix** defined above.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input**\n\\[ \"LUPrefix \",  \"upload \",  \"longest \",  \"upload \",  \"longest \",  \"upload \",  \"longest \"\\]\n\\[\\[4\\], \\[3\\], \\[\\], \\[1\\], \\[\\], \\[2\\], \\[\\]\\]\n**Output**\n\\[null, null, 0, null, 1, null, 3\\]\n\n**Explanation**\nLUPrefix server = new LUPrefix(4);   // Initialize a stream of 4 videos.\nserver.upload(3);                    // Upload video 3.\nserver.longest();                    // Since video 1 has not been uploaded yet, there is no prefix.\n                                     // So, we return 0.\nserver.upload(1);                    // Upload video 1.\nserver.longest();                    // The prefix \\[1\\] is the longest uploaded prefix, so we return 1.\nserver.upload(2);                    // Upload video 2.\nserver.longest();                    // The prefix \\[1,2,3\\] is the longest uploaded prefix, so we return 3.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= n <= 105`\n*   `1 <= video <= n`\n*   All values of `video` are **distinct**.\n*   At most `2 * 105` calls **in total** will be made to `upload` and `longest`.\n*   At least one call will be made to `longest`.",
