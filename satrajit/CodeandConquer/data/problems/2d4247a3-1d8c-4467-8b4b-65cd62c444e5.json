  "description": "There are `n` people in a line queuing to buy tickets, where the `0th` person is at the **front** of the line and the `(n - 1)th` person is at the **back** of the line.\n\nYou are given a **0-indexed** integer array `tickets` of length `n` where the number of tickets that the `ith` person would like to buy is `tickets[i]`.\n\nEach person takes **exactly 1 second** to buy a ticket. A person can only buy **1 ticket at a time** and has to go back to **the end** of the line (which happens **instantaneously**) in order to buy more tickets. If a person does not have any tickets left to buy, the person will **leave** the line.\n\nReturn _the **time taken** for the person at position_ `k` **_(0-indexed)_** _to finish buying tickets_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** tickets = \\[2,3,2\\], k = 2\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:** \n- In the first pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes \\[1, 2, 1\\].\n- In the second pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes \\[0, 1, 0\\].\nThe person at position 2 has successfully bought 2 tickets and it took 3 + 3 = 6 seconds.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** tickets = \\[5,1,1,1\\], k = 0\n**Output:** 8\n**Explanation:**\n- In the first pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes \\[4, 0, 0, 0\\].\n- In the next 4 passes, only the person in position 0 is buying tickets.\nThe person at position 0 has successfully bought 5 tickets and it took 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 seconds.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == tickets.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 100`\n*   `1 <= tickets[i] <= 100`\n*   `0 <= k < n`",
