  "description": "There are several consecutive houses along a street, each of which has some money inside. There is also a robber, who wants to steal money from the homes, but he **refuses to steal from adjacent homes**.\n\nThe **capability** of the robber is the maximum amount of money he steals from one house of all the houses he robbed.\n\nYou are given an integer array `nums` representing how much money is stashed in each house. More formally, the `ith` house from the left has `nums[i]` dollars.\n\nYou are also given an integer `k`, representing the **minimum** number of houses the robber will steal from. It is always possible to steal at least `k` houses.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** capability of the robber out of all the possible ways to steal at least_ `k` _houses_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[2,3,5,9\\], k = 2\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** \nThere are three ways to rob at least 2 houses:\n- Rob the houses at indices 0 and 2. Capability is max(nums\\[0\\], nums\\[2\\]) = 5.\n- Rob the houses at indices 0 and 3. Capability is max(nums\\[0\\], nums\\[3\\]) = 9.\n- Rob the houses at indices 1 and 3. Capability is max(nums\\[1\\], nums\\[3\\]) = 9.\nTherefore, we return min(5, 9, 9) = 5.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[2,7,9,3,1\\], k = 2\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** There are 7 ways to rob the houses. The way which leads to minimum capability is to rob the house at index 0 and 4. Return max(nums\\[0\\], nums\\[4\\]) = 2.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`\n*   `1 <= k <= (nums.length + 1)/2`",
