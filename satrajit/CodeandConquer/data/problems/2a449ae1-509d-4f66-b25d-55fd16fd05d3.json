  "description": "A scenic location is represented by its `name` and attractiveness `score`, where `name` is a **unique** string among all locations and `score` is an integer. Locations can be ranked from the best to the worst. The **higher** the score, the better the location. If the scores of two locations are equal, then the location with the **lexicographically smaller** name is better.\n\nYou are building a system that tracks the ranking of locations with the system initially starting with no locations. It supports:\n\n*   **Adding** scenic locations, **one at a time**.\n*   **Querying** the `ith` **best** location of **all locations already added**, where `i` is the number of times the system has been queried (including the current query).\n    *   For example, when the system is queried for the `4th` time, it returns the `4th` best location of all locations already added.\n\nNote that the test data are generated so that **at any time**, the number of queries **does not exceed** the number of locations added to the system.\n\nImplement the `SORTracker` class:\n\n*   `SORTracker()` Initializes the tracker system.\n*   `void add(string name, int score)` Adds a scenic location with `name` and `score` to the system.\n*   `string get()` Queries and returns the `ith` best location, where `i` is the number of times this method has been invoked (including this invocation).\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input**\n\\[ \"SORTracker \",  \"add \",  \"add \",  \"get \",  \"add \",  \"get \",  \"add \",  \"get \",  \"add \",  \"get \",  \"add \",  \"get \",  \"get \"\\]\n\\[\\[\\], \\[ \"bradford \", 2\\], \\[ \"branford \", 3\\], \\[\\], \\[ \"alps \", 2\\], \\[\\], \\[ \"orland \", 2\\], \\[\\], \\[ \"orlando \", 3\\], \\[\\], \\[ \"alpine \", 2\\], \\[\\], \\[\\]\\]\n**Output**\n\\[null, null, null,  \"branford \", null,  \"alps \", null,  \"bradford \", null,  \"bradford \", null,  \"bradford \",  \"orland \"\\]\n\n**Explanation**\nSORTracker tracker = new SORTracker(); // Initialize the tracker system.\ntracker.add( \"bradford \", 2); // Add location with name= \"bradford \" and score=2 to the system.\ntracker.add( \"branford \", 3); // Add location with name= \"branford \" and score=3 to the system.\ntracker.get();              // The sorted locations, from best to worst, are: branford, bradford.\n                            // Note that branford precedes bradford due to its **higher score** (3 > 2).\n                            // This is the 1st time get() is called, so return the best location:  \"branford \".\ntracker.add( \"alps \", 2);     // Add location with name= \"alps \" and score=2 to the system.\ntracker.get();              // Sorted locations: branford, alps, bradford.\n                            // Note that alps precedes bradford even though they have the same score (2).\n                            // This is because  \"alps \" is **lexicographically smaller** than  \"bradford \".\n                            // Return the 2nd best location  \"alps \", as it is the 2nd time get() is called.\ntracker.add( \"orland \", 2);   // Add location with name= \"orland \" and score=2 to the system.\ntracker.get();              // Sorted locations: branford, alps, bradford, orland.\n                            // Return  \"bradford \", as it is the 3rd time get() is called.\ntracker.add( \"orlando \", 3);  // Add location with name= \"orlando \" and score=3 to the system.\ntracker.get();              // Sorted locations: branford, orlando, alps, bradford, orland.\n                            // Return  \"bradford \".\ntracker.add( \"alpine \", 2);   // Add location with name= \"alpine \" and score=2 to the system.\ntracker.get();              // Sorted locations: branford, orlando, alpine, alps, bradford, orland.\n                            // Return  \"bradford \".\ntracker.get();              // Sorted locations: branford, orlando, alpine, alps, bradford, orland.\n                            // Return  \"orland \".\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `name` consists of lowercase English letters, and is unique among all locations.\n*   `1 <= name.length <= 10`\n*   `1 <= score <= 105`\n*   At any time, the number of calls to `get` does not exceed the number of calls to `add`.\n*   At most `4 * 104` calls **in total** will be made to `add` and `get`.",
