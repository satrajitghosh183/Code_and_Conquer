  "description": "You have `n` flower seeds. Every seed must be planted first before it can begin to grow, then bloom. Planting a seed takes time and so does the growth of a seed. You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `plantTime` and `growTime`, of length `n` each:\n\n*   `plantTime[i]` is the number of **full days** it takes you to **plant** the `ith` seed. Every day, you can work on planting exactly one seed. You **do not** have to work on planting the same seed on consecutive days, but the planting of a seed is not complete **until** you have worked `plantTime[i]` days on planting it in total.\n*   `growTime[i]` is the number of **full days** it takes the `ith` seed to grow after being completely planted. **After** the last day of its growth, the flower **blooms** and stays bloomed forever.\n\nFrom the beginning of day `0`, you can plant the seeds in **any** order.\n\nReturn _the **earliest** possible day where **all** seeds are blooming_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** plantTime = \\[1,4,3\\], growTime = \\[2,3,1\\]\n**Output:** 9\n**Explanation:** The grayed out pots represent planting days, colored pots represent growing days, and the flower represents the day it blooms.\nOne optimal way is:\nOn day 0, plant the 0th seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 3.\nOn days 1, 2, 3, and 4, plant the 1st seed. The seed grows for 3 full days and blooms on day 8.\nOn days 5, 6, and 7, plant the 2nd seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 9.\nThus, on day 9, all the seeds are blooming.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** plantTime = \\[1,2,3,2\\], growTime = \\[2,1,2,1\\]\n**Output:** 9\n**Explanation:** The grayed out pots represent planting days, colored pots represent growing days, and the flower represents the day it blooms.\nOne optimal way is:\nOn day 1, plant the 0th seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 4.\nOn days 0 and 3, plant the 1st seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 5.\nOn days 2, 4, and 5, plant the 2nd seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 8.\nOn days 6 and 7, plant the 3rd seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 9.\nThus, on day 9, all the seeds are blooming.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** plantTime = \\[1\\], growTime = \\[1\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** On day 0, plant the 0th seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 2.\nThus, on day 2, all the seeds are blooming.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == plantTime.length == growTime.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 105`\n*   `1 <= plantTime[i], growTime[i] <= 104`",
