  "description": "A **subsequence** of a string is good if it is not empty and the frequency of each one of its characters is the same.\n\nGiven a string `s`, return _the number of good subsequences of_ `s`. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.\n\nA **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"aabb \"\n**Output:** 11\n**Explanation:** The total number of subsequences is `24.` There are five subsequences which are not good:  \"**aab**b \",  \"a**abb** \",  \"**a**a**bb** \",  \"**aa**b**b** \", and the empty subsequence. Hence, the number of good subsequences is `24-5 = 11`.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"leet \"\n**Output:** 12\n**Explanation:** There are four subsequences which are not good:  \"**l_ee_**t \",  \"l**eet** \",  \"**leet** \", and the empty subsequence. Hence, the number of good subsequences is `24-4 = 12`.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"abcd \"\n**Output:** 15\n**Explanation:** All of the non-empty subsequences are good subsequences. Hence, the number of good subsequences is `24-1 = 15`.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= s.length <= 104`\n*   `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.",
