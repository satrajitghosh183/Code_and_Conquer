  "description": "Alice is a caretaker of `n` gardens and she wants to plant flowers to maximize the total beauty of all her gardens.\n\nYou are given a **0-indexed** integer array `flowers` of size `n`, where `flowers[i]` is the number of flowers already planted in the `ith` garden. Flowers that are already planted **cannot** be removed. You are then given another integer `newFlowers`, which is the **maximum** number of flowers that Alice can additionally plant. You are also given the integers `target`, `full`, and `partial`.\n\nA garden is considered **complete** if it has **at least** `target` flowers. The **total beauty** of the gardens is then determined as the **sum** of the following:\n\n*   The number of **complete** gardens multiplied by `full`.\n*   The **minimum** number of flowers in any of the **incomplete** gardens multiplied by `partial`. If there are no incomplete gardens, then this value will be `0`.\n\nReturn _the **maximum** total beauty that Alice can obtain after planting at most_ `newFlowers` _flowers._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** flowers = \\[1,3,1,1\\], newFlowers = 7, target = 6, full = 12, partial = 1\n**Output:** 14\n**Explanation:** Alice can plant\n- 2 flowers in the 0th garden\n- 3 flowers in the 1st garden\n- 1 flower in the 2nd garden\n- 1 flower in the 3rd garden\nThe gardens will then be \\[3,6,2,2\\]. She planted a total of 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 7 flowers.\nThere is 1 garden that is complete.\nThe minimum number of flowers in the incomplete gardens is 2.\nThus, the total beauty is 1 \\* 12 + 2 \\* 1 = 12 + 2 = 14.\nNo other way of planting flowers can obtain a total beauty higher than 14.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** flowers = \\[2,4,5,3\\], newFlowers = 10, target = 5, full = 2, partial = 6\n**Output:** 30\n**Explanation:** Alice can plant\n- 3 flowers in the 0th garden\n- 0 flowers in the 1st garden\n- 0 flowers in the 2nd garden\n- 2 flowers in the 3rd garden\nThe gardens will then be \\[5,4,5,5\\]. She planted a total of 3 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 5 flowers.\nThere are 3 gardens that are complete.\nThe minimum number of flowers in the incomplete gardens is 4.\nThus, the total beauty is 3 \\* 2 + 4 \\* 6 = 6 + 24 = 30.\nNo other way of planting flowers can obtain a total beauty higher than 30.\nNote that Alice could make all the gardens complete but in this case, she would obtain a lower total beauty.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= flowers.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= flowers[i], target <= 105`\n*   `1 <= newFlowers <= 1010`\n*   `1 <= full, partial <= 105`",
