  "description": "We have `n` buildings numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Each building has a number of employees. It's transfer season, and some employees want to change the building they reside in.\n\nYou are given an array `requests` where `requests[i] = [fromi, toi]` represents an employee's request to transfer from building `fromi` to building `toi`.\n\n**All buildings are full**, so a list of requests is achievable only if for each building, the **net change in employee transfers is zero**. This means the number of employees **leaving** is **equal** to the number of employees **moving in**. For example if `n = 3` and two employees are leaving building `0`, one is leaving building `1`, and one is leaving building `2`, there should be two employees moving to building `0`, one employee moving to building `1`, and one employee moving to building `2`.\n\nReturn _the maximum number of achievable requests_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 5, requests = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[1,0\\],\\[0,1\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[2,0\\],\\[3,4\\]\\]\n**Output:** 5\n**Explantion:** Let's see the requests:\nFrom building 0 we have employees x and y and both want to move to building 1.\nFrom building 1 we have employees a and b and they want to move to buildings 2 and 0 respectively.\nFrom building 2 we have employee z and they want to move to building 0.\nFrom building 3 we have employee c and they want to move to building 4.\nFrom building 4 we don't have any requests.\nWe can achieve the requests of users x and b by swapping their places.\nWe can achieve the requests of users y, a and z by swapping the places in the 3 buildings.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 3, requests = \\[\\[0,0\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[2,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explantion:** Let's see the requests:\nFrom building 0 we have employee x and they want to stay in the same building 0.\nFrom building 1 we have employee y and they want to move to building 2.\nFrom building 2 we have employee z and they want to move to building 1.\nWe can achieve all the requests. \n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** n = 4, requests = \\[\\[0,3\\],\\[3,1\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[2,0\\]\\]\n**Output:** 4\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= n <= 20`\n*   `1 <= requests.length <= 16`\n*   `requests[i].length == 2`\n*   `0 <= fromi, toi < n`",
