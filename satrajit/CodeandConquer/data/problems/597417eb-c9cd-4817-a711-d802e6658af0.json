  "description": "There are `n` hens and `m` grains on a line. You are given the initial positions of the hens and the grains in two integer arrays `hens` and `grains` of size `n` and `m` respectively.\n\nAny hen can eat a grain if they are on the same position. The time taken for this is negligible. One hen can also eat multiple grains.\n\nIn `1` second, a hen can move right or left by `1` unit. The hens can move simultaneously and independently of each other.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** time to eat all grains if the hens act optimally._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** hens = \\[3,6,7\\], grains = \\[2,4,7,9\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** \nOne of the ways hens eat all grains in 2 seconds is described below:\n- The first hen eats the grain at position 2 in 1 second. \n- The second hen eats the grain at position 4 in 2 seconds. \n- The third hen eats the grains at positions 7 and 9 in 2 seconds. \nSo, the maximum time needed is 2.\nIt can be proven that the hens cannot eat all grains before 2 seconds.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** hens = \\[4,6,109,111,213,215\\], grains = \\[5,110,214\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** \nOne of the ways hens eat all grains in 1 second is described below:\n- The first hen eats the grain at position 5 in 1 second. \n- The fourth hen eats the grain at position 110 in 1 second.\n- The sixth hen eats the grain at position 214 in 1 second. \n- The other hens do not move. \nSo, the maximum time needed is 1.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= hens.length, grains.length <= 2*104`\n*   `0 <= hens[i], grains[j] <= 109`",
