  "description": "You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `points` (**0-indexed**). Starting with `0` points, you want to **maximize** the number of points you can get from the matrix.\n\nTo gain points, you must pick one cell in **each row**. Picking the cell at coordinates `(r, c)` will **add** `points[r][c]` to your score.\n\nHowever, you will lose points if you pick a cell too far from the cell that you picked in the previous row. For every two adjacent rows `r` and `r + 1` (where `0 <= r < m - 1`), picking cells at coordinates `(r, c1)` and `(r + 1, c2)` will **subtract** `abs(c1 - c2)` from your score.\n\nReturn _the **maximum** number of points you can achieve_.\n\n`abs(x)` is defined as:\n\n*   `x` for `x >= 0`.\n*   `-x` for `x < 0`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** points = \\[\\[1,2,3\\],\\[1,5,1\\],\\[3,1,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** 9\n**Explanation:**\nThe blue cells denote the optimal cells to pick, which have coordinates (0, 2), (1, 1), and (2, 0).\nYou add 3 + 5 + 3 = 11 to your score.\nHowever, you must subtract abs(2 - 1) + abs(1 - 0) = 2 from your score.\nYour final score is 11 - 2 = 9.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** points = \\[\\[1,5\\],\\[2,3\\],\\[4,2\\]\\]\n**Output:** 11\n**Explanation:**\nThe blue cells denote the optimal cells to pick, which have coordinates (0, 1), (1, 1), and (2, 0).\nYou add 5 + 3 + 4 = 12 to your score.\nHowever, you must subtract abs(1 - 1) + abs(1 - 0) = 1 from your score.\nYour final score is 12 - 1 = 11.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `m == points.length`\n*   `n == points[r].length`\n*   `1 <= m, n <= 105`\n*   `1 <= m * n <= 105`\n*   `0 <= points[r][c] <= 105`",
