  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** string `blocks` of length `n`, where `blocks[i]` is either `'W'` or `'B'`, representing the color of the `ith` block. The characters `'W'` and `'B'` denote the colors white and black, respectively.\n\nYou are also given an integer `k`, which is the desired number of **consecutive** black blocks.\n\nIn one operation, you can **recolor** a white block such that it becomes a black block.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** number of operations needed such that there is at least **one** occurrence of_ `k` _consecutive black blocks._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** blocks =  \"WBBWWBBWBW \", k = 7\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:**\nOne way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks is to recolor the 0th, 3rd, and 4th blocks\nso that blocks =  \"BBBBBBBWBW \". \nIt can be shown that there is no way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks in less than 3 operations.\nTherefore, we return 3.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** blocks =  \"WBWBBBW \", k = 2\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:**\nNo changes need to be made, since 2 consecutive black blocks already exist.\nTherefore, we return 0.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == blocks.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 100`\n*   `blocks[i]` is either `'W'` or `'B'`.\n*   `1 <= k <= n`",
