  "slug": "delete-greatest-value-in-each-row",
  "description": "You are given an `m x n` matrix `grid` consisting of positive integers.\n\nPerform the following operation until `grid` becomes empty:\n\n*   Delete the element with the greatest value from each row. If multiple such elements exist, delete any of them.\n*   Add the maximum of deleted elements to the answer.\n\n**Note** that the number of columns decreases by one after each operation.\n\nReturn _the answer after performing the operations described above_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[1,2,4\\],\\[3,3,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** 8\n**Explanation:** The diagram above shows the removed values in each step.\n- In the first operation, we remove 4 from the first row and 3 from the second row (notice that, there are two cells with value 3 and we can remove any of them). We add 4 to the answer.\n- In the second operation, we remove 2 from the first row and 3 from the second row. We add 3 to the answer.\n- In the third operation, we remove 1 from the first row and 1 from the second row. We add 1 to the answer.\nThe final answer = 4 + 3 + 1 = 8.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[10\\]\\]\n**Output:** 10\n**Explanation:** The diagram above shows the removed values in each step.\n- In the first operation, we remove 10 from the first row. We add 10 to the answer.\nThe final answer = 10.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `m == grid.length`\n*   `n == grid[i].length`\n*   `1 <= m, n <= 50`\n*   `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`",
