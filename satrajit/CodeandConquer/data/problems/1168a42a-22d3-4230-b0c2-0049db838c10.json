  "description": "A **sentence** is a string of single-space separated words where each word can contain digits, lowercase letters, and the dollar sign `'$'`. A word represents a **price** if it is a sequence of digits preceded by a dollar sign.\n\n*   For example, `\"$100 \"`, `\"$23 \"`, and `\"$6 \"` represent prices while `\"100 \"`, `\"$ \"`, and `\"$1e5 \"` do not.\n\nYou are given a string `sentence` representing a sentence and an integer `discount`. For each word representing a price, apply a discount of `discount%` on the price and **update** the word in the sentence. All updated prices should be represented with **exactly two** decimal places.\n\nReturn _a string representing the modified sentence_.\n\nNote that all prices will contain **at most** `10` digits.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** sentence =  \"there are $1 $2 and 5$ candies in the shop \", discount = 50\n**Output:**  \"there are $0.50 $1.00 and 5$ candies in the shop \"\n**Explanation:** \nThe words which represent prices are  \"$1 \" and  \"$2 \". \n- A 50% discount on  \"$1 \" yields  \"$0.50 \", so  \"$1 \" is replaced by  \"$0.50 \".\n- A 50% discount on  \"$2 \" yields  \"$1 \". Since we need to have exactly 2 decimal places after a price, we replace  \"$2 \" with  \"$1.00 \".\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** sentence =  \"1 2 $3 4 $5 $6 7 8$ $9 $10$ \", discount = 100\n**Output:**  \"1 2 $0.00 4 $0.00 $0.00 7 8$ $0.00 $10$ \"\n**Explanation:** \nApplying a 100% discount on any price will result in 0.\nThe words representing prices are  \"$3 \",  \"$5 \",  \"$6 \", and  \"$9 \".\nEach of them is replaced by  \"$0.00 \".\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= sentence.length <= 105`\n*   `sentence` consists of lowercase English letters, digits, `' '`, and `'$'`.\n*   `sentence` does not have leading or trailing spaces.\n*   All words in `sentence` are separated by a single space.\n*   All prices will be **positive** numbers without leading zeros.\n*   All prices will have **at most** `10` digits.\n*   `0 <= discount <= 100`",
