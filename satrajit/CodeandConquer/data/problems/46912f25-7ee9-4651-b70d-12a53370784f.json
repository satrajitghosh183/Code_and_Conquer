  "description": "Given two string arrays `words1` and `words2`, return _the number of strings that appear **exactly once** in **each** of the two arrays._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** words1 = \\[ \"leetcode \", \"is \", \"amazing \", \"as \", \"is \"\\], words2 = \\[ \"amazing \", \"leetcode \", \"is \"\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:**\n-  \"leetcode \" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.\n-  \"amazing \" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.\n-  \"is \" appears in each of the two arrays, but there are 2 occurrences of it in words1. We do not count this string.\n-  \"as \" appears once in words1, but does not appear in words2. We do not count this string.\nThus, there are 2 strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** words1 = \\[ \"b \", \"bb \", \"bbb \"\\], words2 = \\[ \"a \", \"aa \", \"aaa \"\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** There are no strings that appear in each of the two arrays.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** words1 = \\[ \"a \", \"ab \"\\], words2 = \\[ \"a \", \"a \", \"a \", \"ab \"\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** The only string that appears exactly once in each of the two arrays is  \"ab \".\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= words1.length, words2.length <= 1000`\n*   `1 <= words1[i].length, words2[j].length <= 30`\n*   `words1[i]` and `words2[j]` consists only of lowercase English letters.",
