  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` binary matrix `matrix` and an integer `numSelect`, which denotes the number of **distinct** columns you must select from `matrix`.\n\nLet us consider `s = {c1, c2, ...., cnumSelect}` as the set of columns selected by you. A row `row` is **covered** by `s` if:\n\n*   For each cell `matrix[row][col]` (`0 <= col <= n - 1`) where `matrix[row][col] == 1`, `col` is present in `s` or,\n*   **No cell** in `row` has a value of `1`.\n\nYou need to choose `numSelect` columns such that the number of rows that are covered is **maximized**.\n\nReturn _the **maximum** number of rows that can be **covered** by a set of_ `numSelect` _columns._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** matrix = \\[\\[0,0,0\\],\\[1,0,1\\],\\[0,1,1\\],\\[0,0,1\\]\\], numSelect = 2\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** One possible way to cover 3 rows is shown in the diagram above.\nWe choose s = {0, 2}.\n- Row 0 is covered because it has no occurrences of 1.\n- Row 1 is covered because the columns with value 1, i.e. 0 and 2 are present in s.\n- Row 2 is not covered because matrix\\[2\\]\\[1\\] == 1 but 1 is not present in s.\n- Row 3 is covered because matrix\\[2\\]\\[2\\] == 1 and 2 is present in s.\nThus, we can cover three rows.\nNote that s = {1, 2} will also cover 3 rows, but it can be shown that no more than three rows can be covered.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** matrix = \\[\\[1\\],\\[0\\]\\], numSelect = 1\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** Selecting the only column will result in both rows being covered since the entire matrix is selected.\nTherefore, we return 2.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `m == matrix.length`\n*   `n == matrix[i].length`\n*   `1 <= m, n <= 12`\n*   `matrix[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.\n*   `1 <= numSelect <= n`",
