  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `transactions`, where `transactions[i] = [costi, cashbacki]`.\n\nThe array describes transactions, where each transaction must be completed exactly once in **some order**. At any given moment, you have a certain amount of `money`. In order to complete transaction `i`, `money >= costi` must hold true. After performing a transaction, `money` becomes `money - costi + cashbacki`.\n\nReturn _the minimum amount of_ `money` _required before any transaction so that all of the transactions can be completed **regardless of the order** of the transactions._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** transactions = \\[\\[2,1\\],\\[5,0\\],\\[4,2\\]\\]\n**Output:** 10\n**Explanation:**\nStarting with money = 10, the transactions can be performed in any order.\nIt can be shown that starting with money < 10 will fail to complete all transactions in some order.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** transactions = \\[\\[3,0\\],\\[0,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:**\n- If transactions are in the order \\[\\[3,0\\],\\[0,3\\]\\], the minimum money required to complete the transactions is 3.\n- If transactions are in the order \\[\\[0,3\\],\\[3,0\\]\\], the minimum money required to complete the transactions is 0.\nThus, starting with money = 3, the transactions can be performed in any order.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= transactions.length <= 105`\n*   `transactions[i].length == 2`\n*   `0 <= costi, cashbacki <= 109`",
