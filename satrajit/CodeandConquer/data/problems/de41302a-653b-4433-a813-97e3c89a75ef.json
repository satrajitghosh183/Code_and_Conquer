  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** array `arr` consisting of `n` positive integers, and a positive integer `k`.\n\nThe array `arr` is called **K-increasing** if `arr[i-k] <= arr[i]` holds for every index `i`, where `k <= i <= n-1`.\n\n*   For example, `arr = [4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 2]` is K-increasing for `k = 2` because:\n    *   `arr[0] <= arr[2] (4 <= 5)`\n    *   `arr[1] <= arr[3] (1 <= 2)`\n    *   `arr[2] <= arr[4] (5 <= 6)`\n    *   `arr[3] <= arr[5] (2 <= 2)`\n*   However, the same `arr` is not K-increasing for `k = 1` (because `arr[0] > arr[1]`) or `k = 3` (because `arr[0] > arr[3]`).\n\nIn one **operation**, you can choose an index `i` and **change** `arr[i]` into **any** positive integer.\n\nReturn _the **minimum number of operations** required to make the array K-increasing for the given_ `k`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** arr = \\[5,4,3,2,1\\], k = 1\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:**\nFor k = 1, the resultant array has to be non-decreasing.\nSome of the K-increasing arrays that can be formed are \\[5,**6**,**7**,**8**,**9**\\], \\[**1**,**1**,**1**,**1**,1\\], \\[**2**,**2**,3,**4**,**4**\\]. All of them require 4 operations.\nIt is suboptimal to change the array to, for example, \\[**6**,**7**,**8**,**9**,**10**\\] because it would take 5 operations.\nIt can be shown that we cannot make the array K-increasing in less than 4 operations.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** arr = \\[4,1,5,2,6,2\\], k = 2\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:**\nThis is the same example as the one in the problem description.\nHere, for every index i where 2 <= i <= 5, arr\\[i-2\\] <= arr\\[i\\].\nSince the given array is already K-increasing, we do not need to perform any operations.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** arr = \\[4,1,5,2,6,2\\], k = 3\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:**\nIndices 3 and 5 are the only ones not satisfying arr\\[i-3\\] <= arr\\[i\\] for 3 <= i <= 5.\nOne of the ways we can make the array K-increasing is by changing arr\\[3\\] to 4 and arr\\[5\\] to 5.\nThe array will now be \\[4,1,5,**4**,6,**5**\\].\nNote that there can be other ways to make the array K-increasing, but none of them require less than 2 operations.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= arr.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= arr[i], k <= arr.length`",
