  "description": "You are given a positive integer `n` representing `n` cities numbered from `1` to `n`. You are also given a **2D** array `roads` where `roads[i] = [ai, bi, distancei]` indicates that there is a **bidirectional** road between cities `ai` and `bi` with a distance equal to `distancei`. The cities graph is not necessarily connected.\n\nThe **score** of a path between two cities is defined as the **minimum** distance of a road in this path.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** possible score of a path between cities_ `1` _and_ `n`.\n\n**Note**:\n\n*   A path is a sequence of roads between two cities.\n*   It is allowed for a path to contain the same road **multiple** times, and you can visit cities `1` and `n` multiple times along the path.\n*   The test cases are generated such that there is **at least** one path between `1` and `n`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 4, roads = \\[\\[1,2,9\\],\\[2,3,6\\],\\[2,4,5\\],\\[1,4,7\\]\\]\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 4. The score of this path is min(9,5) = 5.\nIt can be shown that no other path has less score.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 4, roads = \\[\\[1,2,2\\],\\[1,3,4\\],\\[3,4,7\\]\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4. The score of this path is min(2,2,4,7) = 2.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= n <= 105`\n*   `1 <= roads.length <= 105`\n*   `roads[i].length == 3`\n*   `1 <= ai, bi <= n`\n*   `ai != bi`\n*   `1 <= distancei <= 104`\n*   There are no repeated edges.\n*   There is at least one path between `1` and `n`.",
