  "description": "You and a gang of thieves are planning on robbing a bank. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `security`, where `security[i]` is the number of guards on duty on the `ith` day. The days are numbered starting from `0`. You are also given an integer `time`.\n\nThe `ith` day is a good day to rob the bank if:\n\n*   There are at least `time` days before and after the `ith` day,\n*   The number of guards at the bank for the `time` days **before** `i` are **non-increasing**, and\n*   The number of guards at the bank for the `time` days **after** `i` are **non-decreasing**.\n\nMore formally, this means day `i` is a good day to rob the bank if and only if `security[i - time] >= security[i - time + 1] >= ... >= security[i] <= ... <= security[i + time - 1] <= security[i + time]`.\n\nReturn _a list of **all** days **(0-indexed)** that are good days to rob the bank_. _The order that the days are returned in does **not** matter._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** security = \\[5,3,3,3,5,6,2\\], time = 2\n**Output:** \\[2,3\\]\n**Explanation:**\nOn day 2, we have security\\[0\\] >= security\\[1\\] >= security\\[2\\] <= security\\[3\\] <= security\\[4\\].\nOn day 3, we have security\\[1\\] >= security\\[2\\] >= security\\[3\\] <= security\\[4\\] <= security\\[5\\].\nNo other days satisfy this condition, so days 2 and 3 are the only good days to rob the bank.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** security = \\[1,1,1,1,1\\], time = 0\n**Output:** \\[0,1,2,3,4\\]\n**Explanation:**\nSince time equals 0, every day is a good day to rob the bank, so return every day.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** security = \\[1,2,3,4,5,6\\], time = 2\n**Output:** \\[\\]\n**Explanation:**\nNo day has 2 days before it that have a non-increasing number of guards.\nThus, no day is a good day to rob the bank, so return an empty list.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= security.length <= 105`\n*   `0 <= security[i], time <= 105`",
