  "description": "You are given a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes of a **Directed Acyclic Graph** (DAG). The nodes are numbered from `0` to `n - 1` (**inclusive**).\n\nYou are also given a 2D integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi]` denotes that there is a **unidirectional** edge from `fromi` to `toi` in the graph.\n\nReturn _a list_ `answer`_, where_ `answer[i]` _is the **list of ancestors** of the_ `ith` _node, sorted in **ascending order**_.\n\nA node `u` is an **ancestor** of another node `v` if `u` can reach `v` via a set of edges.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 8, edgeList = \\[\\[0,3\\],\\[0,4\\],\\[1,3\\],\\[2,4\\],\\[2,7\\],\\[3,5\\],\\[3,6\\],\\[3,7\\],\\[4,6\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[\\[\\],\\[\\],\\[\\],\\[0,1\\],\\[0,2\\],\\[0,1,3\\],\\[0,1,2,3,4\\],\\[0,1,2,3\\]\\]\n**Explanation:**\nThe above diagram represents the input graph.\n- Nodes 0, 1, and 2 do not have any ancestors.\n- Node 3 has two ancestors 0 and 1.\n- Node 4 has two ancestors 0 and 2.\n- Node 5 has three ancestors 0, 1, and 3.\n- Node 6 has five ancestors 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n- Node 7 has four ancestors 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 5, edgeList = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[0,2\\],\\[0,3\\],\\[0,4\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[1,3\\],\\[1,4\\],\\[2,3\\],\\[2,4\\],\\[3,4\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[\\[\\],\\[0\\],\\[0,1\\],\\[0,1,2\\],\\[0,1,2,3\\]\\]\n**Explanation:**\nThe above diagram represents the input graph.\n- Node 0 does not have any ancestor.\n- Node 1 has one ancestor 0.\n- Node 2 has two ancestors 0 and 1.\n- Node 3 has three ancestors 0, 1, and 2.\n- Node 4 has four ancestors 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= n <= 1000`\n*   `0 <= edges.length <= min(2000, n * (n - 1) / 2)`\n*   `edges[i].length == 2`\n*   `0 <= fromi, toi <= n - 1`\n*   `fromi != toi`\n*   There are no duplicate edges.\n*   The graph is **directed** and **acyclic**.",
