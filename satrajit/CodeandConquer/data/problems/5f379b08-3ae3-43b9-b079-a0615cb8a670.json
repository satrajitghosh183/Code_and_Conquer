  "description": "You are given an `m x n` binary grid `grid` where `1` represents land and `0` represents water. An **island** is a maximal **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical) connected group of `1`'s.\n\nThe grid is said to be **connected** if we have **exactly one island**, otherwise is said **disconnected**.\n\nIn one day, we are allowed to change **any** single land cell `(1)` into a water cell `(0)`.\n\nReturn _the minimum number of days to disconnect the grid_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[0,1,1,0\\],\\[0,1,1,0\\],\\[0,0,0,0\\]\\]\n\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** We need at least 2 days to get a disconnected grid.\nChange land grid\\[1\\]\\[1\\] and grid\\[0\\]\\[2\\] to water and get 2 disconnected island.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[1,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** Grid of full water is also disconnected (\\[\\[1,1\\]\\] -> \\[\\[0,0\\]\\]), 0 islands.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `m == grid.length`\n*   `n == grid[i].length`\n*   `1 <= m, n <= 30`\n*   `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.",
