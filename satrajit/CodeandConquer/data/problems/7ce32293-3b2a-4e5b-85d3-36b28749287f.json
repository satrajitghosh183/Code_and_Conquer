  "description": "You are given a string `s` consisting only of lowercase English letters.\n\nIn one **move**, you can select any two **adjacent** characters of `s` and swap them.\n\nReturn _the **minimum number of moves** needed to make_ `s` _a palindrome_.\n\n**Note** that the input will be generated such that `s` can always be converted to a palindrome.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"aabb \"\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:**\nWe can obtain two palindromes from s,  \"abba \" and  \"baab \". \n- We can obtain  \"abba \" from s in 2 moves:  \"a**ab**b \" ->  \"ab**ab** \" ->  \"abba \".\n- We can obtain  \"baab \" from s in 2 moves:  \"a**ab**b \" ->  \"**ab**ab \" ->  \"baab \".\nThus, the minimum number of moves needed to make s a palindrome is 2.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"letelt \"\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:**\nOne of the palindromes we can obtain from s in 2 moves is  \"lettel \".\nOne of the ways we can obtain it is  \"lete**lt** \" ->  \"let**et**l \" ->  \"lettel \".\nOther palindromes such as  \"tleelt \" can also be obtained in 2 moves.\nIt can be shown that it is not possible to obtain a palindrome in less than 2 moves.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= s.length <= 2000`\n*   `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.\n*   `s` can be converted to a palindrome using a finite number of moves.",
