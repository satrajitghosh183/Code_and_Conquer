  "description": "There is a computer that can run an unlimited number of tasks **at the same time**. You are given a 2D integer array `tasks` where `tasks[i] = [starti, endi, durationi]` indicates that the `ith` task should run for a total of `durationi` seconds (not necessarily continuous) within the **inclusive** time range `[starti, endi]`.\n\nYou may turn on the computer only when it needs to run a task. You can also turn it off if it is idle.\n\nReturn _the minimum time during which the computer should be turned on to complete all tasks_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** tasks = \\[\\[2,3,1\\],\\[4,5,1\\],\\[1,5,2\\]\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** \n- The first task can be run in the inclusive time range \\[2, 2\\].\n- The second task can be run in the inclusive time range \\[5, 5\\].\n- The third task can be run in the two inclusive time ranges \\[2, 2\\] and \\[5, 5\\].\nThe computer will be on for a total of 2 seconds.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** tasks = \\[\\[1,3,2\\],\\[2,5,3\\],\\[5,6,2\\]\\]\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** \n- The first task can be run in the inclusive time range \\[2, 3\\].\n- The second task can be run in the inclusive time ranges \\[2, 3\\] and \\[5, 5\\].\n- The third task can be run in the two inclusive time range \\[5, 6\\].\nThe computer will be on for a total of 4 seconds.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= tasks.length <= 2000`\n*   `tasks[i].length == 3`\n*   `1 <= starti, endi <= 2000`\n*   `1 <= durationi <= endi - starti + 1`",
