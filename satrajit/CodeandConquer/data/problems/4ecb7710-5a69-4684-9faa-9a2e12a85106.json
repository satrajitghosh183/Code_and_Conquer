  "description": "You are given two **0-indexed** arrays of strings `startWords` and `targetWords`. Each string consists of **lowercase English letters** only.\n\nFor each string in `targetWords`, check if it is possible to choose a string from `startWords` and perform a **conversion operation** on it to be equal to that from `targetWords`.\n\nThe **conversion operation** is described in the following two steps:\n\n1.  **Append** any lowercase letter that is **not present** in the string to its end.\n    *   For example, if the string is `\"abc \"`, the letters `'d'`, `'e'`, or `'y'` can be added to it, but not `'a'`. If `'d'` is added, the resulting string will be `\"abcd \"`.\n2.  **Rearrange** the letters of the new string in **any** arbitrary order.\n    *   For example, `\"abcd \"` can be rearranged to `\"acbd \"`, `\"bacd \"`, `\"cbda \"`, and so on. Note that it can also be rearranged to `\"abcd \"` itself.\n\nReturn _the **number of strings** in_ `targetWords` _that can be obtained by performing the operations on **any** string of_ `startWords`.\n\n**Note** that you will only be verifying if the string in `targetWords` can be obtained from a string in `startWords` by performing the operations. The strings in `startWords` **do not** actually change during this process.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** startWords = \\[ \"ant \", \"act \", \"tack \"\\], targetWords = \\[ \"tack \", \"act \", \"acti \"\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:**\n- In order to form targetWords\\[0\\] =  \"tack \", we use startWords\\[1\\] =  \"act \", append 'k' to it, and rearrange  \"actk \" to  \"tack \".\n- There is no string in startWords that can be used to obtain targetWords\\[1\\] =  \"act \".\n  Note that  \"act \" does exist in startWords, but we **must** append one letter to the string before rearranging it.\n- In order to form targetWords\\[2\\] =  \"acti \", we use startWords\\[1\\] =  \"act \", append 'i' to it, and rearrange  \"acti \" to  \"acti \" itself.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** startWords = \\[ \"ab \", \"a \"\\], targetWords = \\[ \"abc \", \"abcd \"\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:**\n- In order to form targetWords\\[0\\] =  \"abc \", we use startWords\\[0\\] =  \"ab \", add 'c' to it, and rearrange it to  \"abc \".\n- There is no string in startWords that can be used to obtain targetWords\\[1\\] =  \"abcd \".\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= startWords.length, targetWords.length <= 5 * 104`\n*   `1 <= startWords[i].length, targetWords[j].length <= 26`\n*   Each string of `startWords` and `targetWords` consists of lowercase English letters only.\n*   No letter occurs more than once in any string of `startWords` or `targetWords`.",
