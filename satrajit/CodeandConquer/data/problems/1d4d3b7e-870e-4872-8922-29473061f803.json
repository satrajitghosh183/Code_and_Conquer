  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed binary** string `floor`, which represents the colors of tiles on a floor:\n\n*   `floor[i] = '0'` denotes that the `ith` tile of the floor is colored **black**.\n*   On the other hand, `floor[i] = '1'` denotes that the `ith` tile of the floor is colored **white**.\n\nYou are also given `numCarpets` and `carpetLen`. You have `numCarpets` **black** carpets, each of length `carpetLen` tiles. Cover the tiles with the given carpets such that the number of **white** tiles still visible is **minimum**. Carpets may overlap one another.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** number of white tiles still visible._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** floor =  \"10110101 \", numCarpets = 2, carpetLen = 2\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** \nThe figure above shows one way of covering the tiles with the carpets such that only 2 white tiles are visible.\nNo other way of covering the tiles with the carpets can leave less than 2 white tiles visible.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** floor =  \"11111 \", numCarpets = 2, carpetLen = 3\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** \nThe figure above shows one way of covering the tiles with the carpets such that no white tiles are visible.\nNote that the carpets are able to overlap one another.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= carpetLen <= floor.length <= 1000`\n*   `floor[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.\n*   `1 <= numCarpets <= 1000`",
