  "description": "A **sentence** is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each of the words consists of **only** uppercase and lowercase English letters (no punctuation).\n\n*   For example, `\"Hello World \"`, `\"HELLO \"`, and `\"hello world hello world \"` are all sentences.\n\nYou are given a sentence `s`​​​​​​ and an integer `k`​​​​​​. You want to **truncate** `s`​​​​​​ such that it contains only the **first** `k`​​​​​​ words. Return `s`​​​​_​​ after **truncating** it._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"Hello how are you Contestant \", k = 4\n**Output:**  \"Hello how are you \"\n**Explanation:**\nThe words in s are \\[ \"Hello \",  \"how \"  \"are \",  \"you \",  \"Contestant \"\\].\nThe first 4 words are \\[ \"Hello \",  \"how \",  \"are \",  \"you \"\\].\nHence, you should return  \"Hello how are you \".\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"What is the solution to this problem \", k = 4\n**Output:**  \"What is the solution \"\n**Explanation:**\nThe words in s are \\[ \"What \",  \"is \"  \"the \",  \"solution \",  \"to \",  \"this \",  \"problem \"\\].\nThe first 4 words are \\[ \"What \",  \"is \",  \"the \",  \"solution \"\\].\nHence, you should return  \"What is the solution \".\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"chopper is not a tanuki \", k = 5\n**Output:**  \"chopper is not a tanuki \"\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= s.length <= 500`\n*   `k` is in the range `[1, the number of words in s]`.\n*   `s` consist of only lowercase and uppercase English letters and spaces.\n*   The words in `s` are separated by a single space.\n*   There are no leading or trailing spaces.",
