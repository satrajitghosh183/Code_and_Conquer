  "description": "There is a street with `n * 2` **plots**, where there are `n` plots on each side of the street. The plots on each side are numbered from `1` to `n`. On each plot, a house can be placed.\n\nReturn _the number of ways houses can be placed such that no two houses are adjacent to each other on the same side of the street_. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.\n\nNote that if a house is placed on the `ith` plot on one side of the street, a house can also be placed on the `ith` plot on the other side of the street.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 1\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** \nPossible arrangements:\n1. All plots are empty.\n2. A house is placed on one side of the street.\n3. A house is placed on the other side of the street.\n4. Two houses are placed, one on each side of the street.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 2\n**Output:** 9\n**Explanation:** The 9 possible arrangements are shown in the diagram above.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= n <= 104`",
