  "description": "You are given a positive integer `primeFactors`. You are asked to construct a positive integer `n` that satisfies the following conditions:\n\n*   The number of prime factors of `n` (not necessarily distinct) is **at most** `primeFactors`.\n*   The number of nice divisors of `n` is maximized. Note that a divisor of `n` is **nice** if it is divisible by every prime factor of `n`. For example, if `n = 12`, then its prime factors are `[2,2,3]`, then `6` and `12` are nice divisors, while `3` and `4` are not.\n\nReturn _the number of nice divisors of_ `n`. Since that number can be too large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.\n\nNote that a prime number is a natural number greater than `1` that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. The prime factors of a number `n` is a list of prime numbers such that their product equals `n`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** primeFactors = 5\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:** 200 is a valid value of n.\nIt has 5 prime factors: \\[2,2,2,5,5\\], and it has 6 nice divisors: \\[10,20,40,50,100,200\\].\nThere is not other value of n that has at most 5 prime factors and more nice divisors.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** primeFactors = 8\n**Output:** 18\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= primeFactors <= 109`",
