  "description": "You are given an integer array `nums`.\n\nSplitting of an integer array `nums` into **subarrays** is **valid** if:\n\n*   the _greatest common divisor_ of the first and last elements of each subarray is **greater** than `1`, and\n*   each element of `nums` belongs to exactly one subarray.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** number of subarrays in a **valid** subarray splitting of_ `nums`. If a valid subarray splitting is not possible, return `-1`.\n\n**Note** that:\n\n*   The **greatest common divisor** of two numbers is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers.\n*   A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty part of an array.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[2,6,3,4,3\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** We can create a valid split in the following way: \\[2,6\\] | \\[3,4,3\\].\n- The starting element of the 1st subarray is 2 and the ending is 6. Their greatest common divisor is 2, which is greater than 1.\n- The starting element of the 2nd subarray is 3 and the ending is 3. Their greatest common divisor is 3, which is greater than 1.\nIt can be proved that 2 is the minimum number of subarrays that we can obtain in a valid split.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[3,5\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** We can create a valid split in the following way: \\[3\\] | \\[5\\].\n- The starting element of the 1st subarray is 3 and the ending is 3. Their greatest common divisor is 3, which is greater than 1.\n- The starting element of the 2nd subarray is 5 and the ending is 5. Their greatest common divisor is 5, which is greater than 1.\nIt can be proved that 2 is the minimum number of subarrays that we can obtain in a valid split.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[1,2,1\\]\n**Output:** -1\n**Explanation:** It is impossible to create valid split.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`\n*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 105`",
