  "description": "A delivery company wants to build a new service center in a new city. The company knows the positions of all the customers in this city on a 2D-Map and wants to build the new center in a position such that **the sum of the euclidean distances to all customers is minimum**.\n\nGiven an array `positions` where `positions[i] = [xi, yi]` is the position of the `ith` customer on the map, return _the minimum sum of the euclidean distances_ to all customers.\n\nIn other words, you need to choose the position of the service center `[xcentre, ycentre]` such that the following formula is minimized:\n\nAnswers within `10-5` of the actual value will be accepted.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** positions = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[1,0\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[2,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** 4.00000\n**Explanation:** As shown, you can see that choosing \\[xcentre, ycentre\\] = \\[1, 1\\] will make the distance to each customer = 1, the sum of all distances is 4 which is the minimum possible we can achieve.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** positions = \\[\\[1,1\\],\\[3,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** 2.82843\n**Explanation:** The minimum possible sum of distances = sqrt(2) + sqrt(2) = 2.82843\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= positions.length <= 50`\n*   `positions[i].length == 2`\n*   `0 <= xi, yi <= 100`\n\nF(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) for n >= 2.",
