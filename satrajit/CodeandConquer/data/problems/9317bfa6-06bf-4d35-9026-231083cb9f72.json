  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `questions` where `questions[i] = [pointsi, brainpoweri]`.\n\nThe array describes the questions of an exam, where you have to process the questions **in order** (i.e., starting from question `0`) and make a decision whether to **solve** or **skip** each question. Solving question `i` will **earn** you `pointsi` points but you will be **unable** to solve each of the next `brainpoweri` questions. If you skip question `i`, you get to make the decision on the next question.\n\n*   For example, given `questions = [[3, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4], [2, 5]]`:\n    *   If question `0` is solved, you will earn `3` points but you will be unable to solve questions `1` and `2`.\n    *   If instead, question `0` is skipped and question `1` is solved, you will earn `4` points but you will be unable to solve questions `2` and `3`.\n\nReturn _the **maximum** points you can earn for the exam_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** questions = \\[\\[3,2\\],\\[4,3\\],\\[4,4\\],\\[2,5\\]\\]\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** The maximum points can be earned by solving questions 0 and 3.\n- Solve question 0: Earn 3 points, will be unable to solve the next 2 questions\n- Unable to solve questions 1 and 2\n- Solve question 3: Earn 2 points\nTotal points earned: 3 + 2 = 5. There is no other way to earn 5 or more points.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** questions = \\[\\[1,1\\],\\[2,2\\],\\[3,3\\],\\[4,4\\],\\[5,5\\]\\]\n**Output:** 7\n**Explanation:** The maximum points can be earned by solving questions 1 and 4.\n- Skip question 0\n- Solve question 1: Earn 2 points, will be unable to solve the next 2 questions\n- Unable to solve questions 2 and 3\n- Solve question 4: Earn 5 points\nTotal points earned: 2 + 5 = 7. There is no other way to earn 7 or more points.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= questions.length <= 105`\n*   `questions[i].length == 2`\n*   `1 <= pointsi, brainpoweri <= 105`",
