  "description": "There are `n` employees, each with a unique id from `0` to `n - 1`.\n\nYou are given a 2D integer array `logs` where `logs[i] = [idi, leaveTimei]` where:\n\n*   `idi` is the id of the employee that worked on the `ith` task, and\n*   `leaveTimei` is the time at which the employee finished the `ith` task. All the values `leaveTimei` are **unique**.\n\nNote that the `ith` task starts the moment right after the `(i - 1)th` task ends, and the `0th` task starts at time `0`.\n\nReturn _the id of the employee that worked the task with the longest time._ If there is a tie between two or more employees, return _the **smallest** id among them_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 10, logs = \\[\\[0,3\\],\\[2,5\\],\\[0,9\\],\\[1,15\\]\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** \nTask 0 started at 0 and ended at 3 with 3 units of times.\nTask 1 started at 3 and ended at 5 with 2 units of times.\nTask 2 started at 5 and ended at 9 with 4 units of times.\nTask 3 started at 9 and ended at 15 with 6 units of times.\nThe task with the longest time is task 3 and the employee with id 1 is the one that worked on it, so we return 1.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 26, logs = \\[\\[1,1\\],\\[3,7\\],\\[2,12\\],\\[7,17\\]\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** \nTask 0 started at 0 and ended at 1 with 1 unit of times.\nTask 1 started at 1 and ended at 7 with 6 units of times.\nTask 2 started at 7 and ended at 12 with 5 units of times.\nTask 3 started at 12 and ended at 17 with 5 units of times.\nThe tasks with the longest time is task 1. The employees that worked on it is 3, so we return 3.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** n = 2, logs = \\[\\[0,10\\],\\[1,20\\]\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** \nTask 0 started at 0 and ended at 10 with 10 units of times.\nTask 1 started at 10 and ended at 20 with 10 units of times.\nThe tasks with the longest time are tasks 0 and 1. The employees that worked on them are 0 and 1, so we return the smallest id 0.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= n <= 500`\n*   `1 <= logs.length <= 500`\n*   `logs[i].length == 2`\n*   `0 <= idi <= n - 1`\n*   `1 <= leaveTimei <= 500`\n*   `idi != idi+1`\n*   `leaveTimei` are sorted in a strictly increasing order.",
