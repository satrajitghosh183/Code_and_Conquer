  "title": "Minimum Sideway Jumps",
  "slug": "minimum-sideway-jumps",
  "description": "There is a **3 lane road** of length `n` that consists of `n + 1` **points** labeled from `0` to `n`. A frog **starts** at point `0` in the **second** lane and wants to jump to point `n`. However, there could be obstacles along the way.\n\nYou are given an array `obstacles` of length `n + 1` where each `obstacles[i]` (**ranging from 0 to 3**) describes an obstacle on the lane `obstacles[i]` at point `i`. If `obstacles[i] == 0`, there are no obstacles at point `i`. There will be **at most one** obstacle in the 3 lanes at each point.\n\n*   For example, if `obstacles[2] == 1`, then there is an obstacle on lane 1 at point 2.\n\nThe frog can only travel from point `i` to point `i + 1` on the same lane if there is not an obstacle on the lane at point `i + 1`. To avoid obstacles, the frog can also perform a **side jump** to jump to **another** lane (even if they are not adjacent) at the **same** point if there is no obstacle on the new lane.\n\n*   For example, the frog can jump from lane 3 at point 3 to lane 1 at point 3.\n\nReturn _the **minimum number of side jumps** the frog needs to reach **any lane** at point n starting from lane `2` at point 0._\n\n**Note:** There will be no obstacles on points `0` and `n`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** obstacles = \\[0,1,2,3,0\\]\n**Output:** 2 \n**Explanation:** The optimal solution is shown by the arrows above. There are 2 side jumps (red arrows).\nNote that the frog can jump over obstacles only when making side jumps (as shown at point 2).\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** obstacles = \\[0,1,1,3,3,0\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** There are no obstacles on lane 2. No side jumps are required.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** obstacles = \\[0,2,1,0,3,0\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** The optimal solution is shown by the arrows above. There are 2 side jumps.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `obstacles.length == n + 1`\n*   `1 <= n <= 5 * 105`\n*   `0 <= obstacles[i] <= 3`\n*   `obstacles[0] == obstacles[n] == 0`",
