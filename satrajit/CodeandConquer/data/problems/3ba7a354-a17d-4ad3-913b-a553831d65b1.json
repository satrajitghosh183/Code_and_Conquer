  "description": "Given an array of positive integers `nums`, remove the **smallest** subarray (possibly **empty**) such that the **sum** of the remaining elements is divisible by `p`. It is **not** allowed to remove the whole array.\n\nReturn _the length of the smallest subarray that you need to remove, or_ `-1` _if it's impossible_.\n\nA **subarray** is defined as a contiguous block of elements in the array.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[3,1,4,2\\], p = 6\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** The sum of the elements in nums is 10, which is not divisible by 6. We can remove the subarray \\[4\\], and the sum of the remaining elements is 6, which is divisible by 6.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[6,3,5,2\\], p = 9\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** We cannot remove a single element to get a sum divisible by 9. The best way is to remove the subarray \\[5,2\\], leaving us with \\[6,3\\] with sum 9.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[1,2,3\\], p = 3\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** Here the sum is 6. which is already divisible by 3. Thus we do not need to remove anything.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`\n*   `1 <= p <= 109`",
