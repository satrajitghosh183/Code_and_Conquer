  "description": "There are `n` rings and each ring is either red, green, or blue. The rings are distributed **across ten rods** labeled from `0` to `9`.\n\nYou are given a string `rings` of length `2n` that describes the `n` rings that are placed onto the rods. Every two characters in `rings` forms a **color-position pair** that is used to describe each ring where:\n\n*   The **first** character of the `ith` pair denotes the `ith` ring's **color** (`'R'`, `'G'`, `'B'`).\n*   The **second** character of the `ith` pair denotes the **rod** that the `ith` ring is placed on (`'0'` to `'9'`).\n\nFor example, `\"R3G2B1 \"` describes `n == 3` rings: a red ring placed onto the rod labeled 3, a green ring placed onto the rod labeled 2, and a blue ring placed onto the rod labeled 1.\n\nReturn _the number of rods that have **all three colors** of rings on them._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** rings =  \"B0B6G0R6R0R6G9 \"\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** \n- The rod labeled 0 holds 3 rings with all colors: red, green, and blue.\n- The rod labeled 6 holds 3 rings, but it only has red and blue.\n- The rod labeled 9 holds only a green ring.\nThus, the number of rods with all three colors is 1.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** rings =  \"B0R0G0R9R0B0G0 \"\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** \n- The rod labeled 0 holds 6 rings with all colors: red, green, and blue.\n- The rod labeled 9 holds only a red ring.\nThus, the number of rods with all three colors is 1.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** rings =  \"G4 \"\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** \nOnly one ring is given. Thus, no rods have all three colors.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `rings.length == 2 * n`\n*   `1 <= n <= 100`\n*   `rings[i]` where `i` is **even** is either `'R'`, `'G'`, or `'B'` (**0-indexed**).\n*   `rings[i]` where `i` is **odd** is a digit from `'0'` to `'9'` (**0-indexed**).",
