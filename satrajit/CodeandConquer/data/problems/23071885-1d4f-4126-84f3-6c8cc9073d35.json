  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` and are tasked with finding two **non-intersecting palindromic** substrings of **odd** length such that the product of their lengths is maximized.\n\nMore formally, you want to choose four integers `i`, `j`, `k`, `l` such that `0 <= i <= j < k <= l < s.length` and both the substrings `s[i...j]` and `s[k...l]` are palindromes and have odd lengths. `s[i...j]` denotes a substring from index `i` to index `j` **inclusive**.\n\nReturn _the **maximum** possible product of the lengths of the two non-intersecting palindromic substrings._\n\nA **palindrome** is a string that is the same forward and backward. A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"ababbb \"\n**Output:** 9\n**Explanation:** Substrings  \"aba \" and  \"bbb \" are palindromes with odd length. product = 3 \\* 3 = 9.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"zaaaxbbby \"\n**Output:** 9\n**Explanation:** Substrings  \"aaa \" and  \"bbb \" are palindromes with odd length. product = 3 \\* 3 = 9.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= s.length <= 105`\n*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters.",
