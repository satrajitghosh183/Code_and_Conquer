  "description": "There are `n` cars on an infinitely long road. The cars are numbered from `0` to `n - 1` from left to right and each car is present at a **unique** point.\n\nYou are given a **0-indexed** string `directions` of length `n`. `directions[i]` can be either `'L'`, `'R'`, or `'S'` denoting whether the `ith` car is moving towards the **left**, towards the **right**, or **staying** at its current point respectively. Each moving car has the **same speed**.\n\nThe number of collisions can be calculated as follows:\n\n*   When two cars moving in **opposite** directions collide with each other, the number of collisions increases by `2`.\n*   When a moving car collides with a stationary car, the number of collisions increases by `1`.\n\nAfter a collision, the cars involved can no longer move and will stay at the point where they collided. Other than that, cars cannot change their state or direction of motion.\n\nReturn _the **total number of collisions** that will happen on the road_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** directions =  \"RLRSLL \"\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:**\nThe collisions that will happen on the road are:\n- Cars 0 and 1 will collide with each other. Since they are moving in opposite directions, the number of collisions becomes 0 + 2 = 2.\n- Cars 2 and 3 will collide with each other. Since car 3 is stationary, the number of collisions becomes 2 + 1 = 3.\n- Cars 3 and 4 will collide with each other. Since car 3 is stationary, the number of collisions becomes 3 + 1 = 4.\n- Cars 4 and 5 will collide with each other. After car 4 collides with car 3, it will stay at the point of collision and get hit by car 5. The number of collisions becomes 4 + 1 = 5.\nThus, the total number of collisions that will happen on the road is 5. \n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** directions =  \"LLRR \"\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:**\nNo cars will collide with each other. Thus, the total number of collisions that will happen on the road is 0.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= directions.length <= 105`\n*   `directions[i]` is either `'L'`, `'R'`, or `'S'`.",
