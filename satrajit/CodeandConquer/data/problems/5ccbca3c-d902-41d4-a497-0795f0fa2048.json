  "description": "There is a special typewriter with lowercase English letters `'a'` to `'z'` arranged in a **circle** with a **pointer**. A character can **only** be typed if the pointer is pointing to that character. The pointer is **initially** pointing to the character `'a'`.\n\nEach second, you may perform one of the following operations:\n\n*   Move the pointer one character **counterclockwise** or **clockwise**.\n*   Type the character the pointer is **currently** on.\n\nGiven a string `word`, return the **minimum** number of seconds to type out the characters in `word`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** word =  \"abc \"\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** \nThe characters are printed as follows:\n- Type the character 'a' in 1 second since the pointer is initially on 'a'.\n- Move the pointer clockwise to 'b' in 1 second.\n- Type the character 'b' in 1 second.\n- Move the pointer clockwise to 'c' in 1 second.\n- Type the character 'c' in 1 second.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** word =  \"bza \"\n**Output:** 7\n**Explanation:**\nThe characters are printed as follows:\n- Move the pointer clockwise to 'b' in 1 second.\n- Type the character 'b' in 1 second.\n- Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'z' in 2 seconds.\n- Type the character 'z' in 1 second.\n- Move the pointer clockwise to 'a' in 1 second.\n- Type the character 'a' in 1 second.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** word =  \"zjpc \"\n**Output:** 34\n**Explanation:**\nThe characters are printed as follows:\n- Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'z' in 1 second.\n- Type the character 'z' in 1 second.\n- Move the pointer clockwise to 'j' in 10 seconds.\n- Type the character 'j' in 1 second.\n- Move the pointer clockwise to 'p' in 6 seconds.\n- Type the character 'p' in 1 second.\n- Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'c' in 13 seconds.\n- Type the character 'c' in 1 second.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= word.length <= 100`\n*   `word` consists of lowercase English letters.",
