  "slug": "count-ways-to-build-rooms-in-an-ant-colony",
  "description": "You are an ant tasked with adding `n` new rooms numbered `0` to `n-1` to your colony. You are given the expansion plan as a **0-indexed** integer array of length `n`, `prevRoom`, where `prevRoom[i]` indicates that you must build room `prevRoom[i]` before building room `i`, and these two rooms must be connected **directly**. Room `0` is already built, so `prevRoom[0] = -1`. The expansion plan is given such that once all the rooms are built, every room will be reachable from room `0`.\n\nYou can only build **one room** at a time, and you can travel freely between rooms you have **already built** only if they are **connected**. You can choose to build **any room** as long as its **previous room** is already built.\n\nReturn _the **number of different orders** you can build all the rooms in_. Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** prevRoom = \\[-1,0,1\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** There is only one way to build the additional rooms: 0 -> 1 -> 2\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** prevRoom = \\[-1,0,0,1,2\\]\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:**\nThe 6 ways are:\n0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4\n0 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3\n0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4\n0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3\n0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4\n0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == prevRoom.length`\n*   `2 <= n <= 105`\n*   `prevRoom[0] == -1`\n*   `0 <= prevRoom[i] < n` for all `1 <= i < n`\n*   Every room is reachable from room `0` once all the rooms are built.",
