  "slug": "maximum-star-sum-of-a-graph",
  "description": "There is an undirected graph consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `vals` of length `n` where `vals[i]` denotes the value of the `ith` node.\n\nYou are also given a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` denotes that there exists an **undirected** edge connecting nodes `ai` and `bi.`\n\nA **star graph** is a subgraph of the given graph having a center node containing `0` or more neighbors. In other words, it is a subset of edges of the given graph such that there exists a common node for all edges.\n\nThe image below shows star graphs with `3` and `4` neighbors respectively, centered at the blue node.\n\nThe **star sum** is the sum of the values of all the nodes present in the star graph.\n\nGiven an integer `k`, return _the **maximum star sum** of a star graph containing **at most**_ `k` _edges._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** vals = \\[1,2,3,4,10,-10,-20\\], edges = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[1,3\\],\\[3,4\\],\\[3,5\\],\\[3,6\\]\\], k = 2\n**Output:** 16\n**Explanation:** The above diagram represents the input graph.\nThe star graph with the maximum star sum is denoted by blue. It is centered at 3 and includes its neighbors 1 and 4.\nIt can be shown it is not possible to get a star graph with a sum greater than 16.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** vals = \\[-5\\], edges = \\[\\], k = 0\n**Output:** -5\n**Explanation:** There is only one possible star graph, which is node 0 itself.\nHence, we return -5.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == vals.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 105`\n*   `-104 <= vals[i] <= 104`\n*   `0 <= edges.length <= min(n * (n - 1) / 2``, 105)`\n*   `edges[i].length == 2`\n*   `0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1`\n*   `ai != bi`\n*   `0 <= k <= n - 1`",
