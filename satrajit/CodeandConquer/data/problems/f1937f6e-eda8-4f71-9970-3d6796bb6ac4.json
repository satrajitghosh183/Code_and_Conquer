  "description": "An experiment is being conducted in a lab. To ensure accuracy, there are **two** sensors collecting data simultaneously. You are given two arrays `sensor1` and `sensor2`, where `sensor1[i]` and `sensor2[i]` are the `ith` data points collected by the two sensors.\n\nHowever, this type of sensor has a chance of being defective, which causes **exactly one** data point to be dropped. After the data is dropped, all the data points to the **right** of the dropped data are **shifted** one place to the left, and the last data point is replaced with some **random value**. It is guaranteed that this random value will **not** be equal to the dropped value.\n\n*   For example, if the correct data is `[1,2,**3**,4,5]` and `3` is dropped, the sensor could return `[1,2,4,5,**7**]` (the last position can be **any** value, not just `7`).\n\nWe know that there is a defect in **at most one** of the sensors. Return _the sensor number (_`1` _or_ `2`_) with the defect. If there is **no defect** in either sensor or if it is **impossible** to determine the defective sensor, return_ `-1`_._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** sensor1 = \\[2,3,4,5\\], sensor2 = \\[2,1,3,4\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** Sensor 2 has the correct values.\nThe second data point from sensor 2 is dropped, and the last value of sensor 1 is replaced by a 5.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** sensor1 = \\[2,2,2,2,2\\], sensor2 = \\[2,2,2,2,5\\]\n**Output:** -1\n**Explanation:** It is impossible to determine which sensor has a defect.\nDropping the last value for either sensor could produce the output for the other sensor.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** sensor1 = \\[2,3,2,2,3,2\\], sensor2 = \\[2,3,2,3,2,7\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** Sensor 1 has the correct values.\nThe fourth data point from sensor 1 is dropped, and the last value of sensor 1 is replaced by a 7.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `sensor1.length == sensor2.length`\n*   `1 <= sensor1.length <= 100`\n*   `1 <= sensor1[i], sensor2[i] <= 100`",
