  "description": "You are given an integer `n`, which indicates that there are `n` courses labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given a 2D integer array `relations` where `relations[j] = [prevCoursej, nextCoursej]` denotes that course `prevCoursej` has to be completed **before** course `nextCoursej` (prerequisite relationship). Furthermore, you are given a **0-indexed** integer array `time` where `time[i]` denotes how many **months** it takes to complete the `(i+1)th` course.\n\nYou must find the **minimum** number of months needed to complete all the courses following these rules:\n\n*   You may start taking a course at **any time** if the prerequisites are met.\n*   **Any number of courses** can be taken at the **same time**.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** number of months needed to complete all the courses_.\n\n**Note:** The test cases are generated such that it is possible to complete every course (i.e., the graph is a directed acyclic graph).\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 3, relations = \\[\\[1,3\\],\\[2,3\\]\\], time = \\[3,2,5\\]\n**Output:** 8\n**Explanation:** The figure above represents the given graph and the time required to complete each course. \nWe start course 1 and course 2 simultaneously at month 0.\nCourse 1 takes 3 months and course 2 takes 2 months to complete respectively.\nThus, the earliest time we can start course 3 is at month 3, and the total time required is 3 + 5 = 8 months.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 5, relations = \\[\\[1,5\\],\\[2,5\\],\\[3,5\\],\\[3,4\\],\\[4,5\\]\\], time = \\[1,2,3,4,5\\]\n**Output:** 12\n**Explanation:** The figure above represents the given graph and the time required to complete each course.\nYou can start courses 1, 2, and 3 at month 0.\nYou can complete them after 1, 2, and 3 months respectively.\nCourse 4 can be taken only after course 3 is completed, i.e., after 3 months. It is completed after 3 + 4 = 7 months.\nCourse 5 can be taken only after courses 1, 2, 3, and 4 have been completed, i.e., after max(1,2,3,7) = 7 months.\nThus, the minimum time needed to complete all the courses is 7 + 5 = 12 months.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= n <= 5 * 104`\n*   `0 <= relations.length <= min(n * (n - 1) / 2, 5 * 104)`\n*   `relations[j].length == 2`\n*   `1 <= prevCoursej, nextCoursej <= n`\n*   `prevCoursej != nextCoursej`\n*   All the pairs `[prevCoursej, nextCoursej]` are **unique**.\n*   `time.length == n`\n*   `1 <= time[i] <= 104`\n*   The given graph is a directed acyclic graph.",
