  "description": "A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. For example, `\"Hello World \"`, `\"HELLO \"`, `\"hello world hello world \"` are all sentences. Words consist of **only** uppercase and lowercase English letters.\n\nTwo sentences `sentence1` and `sentence2` are **similar** if it is possible to insert an arbitrary sentence **(possibly empty)** inside one of these sentences such that the two sentences become equal. For example, `sentence1 = \"Hello my name is Jane \"` and `sentence2 = \"Hello Jane \"` can be made equal by inserting `\"my name is \"` between `\"Hello \"` and `\"Jane \"` in `sentence2`.\n\nGiven two sentences `sentence1` and `sentence2`, return `true` _if_ `sentence1` _and_ `sentence2` _are similar._ Otherwise, return `false`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** sentence1 =  \"My name is Haley \", sentence2 =  \"My Haley \"\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:** sentence2 can be turned to sentence1 by inserting  \"name is \" between  \"My \" and  \"Haley \".\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** sentence1 =  \"of \", sentence2 =  \"A lot of words \"\n**Output:** false\n**Explanation:** No single sentence can be inserted inside one of the sentences to make it equal to the other.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** sentence1 =  \"Eating right now \", sentence2 =  \"Eating \"\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:** sentence2 can be turned to sentence1 by inserting  \"right now \" at the end of the sentence.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= sentence1.length, sentence2.length <= 100`\n*   `sentence1` and `sentence2` consist of lowercase and uppercase English letters and spaces.\n*   The words in `sentence1` and `sentence2` are separated by a single space.",
