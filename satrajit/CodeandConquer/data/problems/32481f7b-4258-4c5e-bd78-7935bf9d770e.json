  "title": "Minimum Initial Energy to Finish Tasks",
  "slug": "minimum-initial-energy-to-finish-tasks",
  "description": "You are given an array `tasks` where `tasks[i] = [actuali, minimumi]`:\n\n*   `actuali` is the actual amount of energy you **spend to finish** the `ith` task.\n*   `minimumi` is the minimum amount of energy you **require to begin** the `ith` task.\n\nFor example, if the task is `[10, 12]` and your current energy is `11`, you cannot start this task. However, if your current energy is `13`, you can complete this task, and your energy will be `3` after finishing it.\n\nYou can finish the tasks in **any order** you like.\n\nReturn _the **minimum** initial amount of energy you will need_ _to finish all the tasks_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** tasks = \\[\\[1,2\\],\\[2,4\\],\\[4,8\\]\\]\n**Output:** 8\n**Explanation:**\nStarting with 8 energy, we finish the tasks in the following order:\n    - 3rd task. Now energy = 8 - 4 = 4.\n    - 2nd task. Now energy = 4 - 2 = 2.\n    - 1st task. Now energy = 2 - 1 = 1.\nNotice that even though we have leftover energy, starting with 7 energy does not work because we cannot do the 3rd task.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** tasks = \\[\\[1,3\\],\\[2,4\\],\\[10,11\\],\\[10,12\\],\\[8,9\\]\\]\n**Output:** 32\n**Explanation:**\nStarting with 32 energy, we finish the tasks in the following order:\n    - 1st task. Now energy = 32 - 1 = 31.\n    - 2nd task. Now energy = 31 - 2 = 29.\n    - 3rd task. Now energy = 29 - 10 = 19.\n    - 4th task. Now energy = 19 - 10 = 9.\n    - 5th task. Now energy = 9 - 8 = 1.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** tasks = \\[\\[1,7\\],\\[2,8\\],\\[3,9\\],\\[4,10\\],\\[5,11\\],\\[6,12\\]\\]\n**Output:** 27\n**Explanation:**\nStarting with 27 energy, we finish the tasks in the following order:\n    - 5th task. Now energy = 27 - 5 = 22.\n    - 2nd task. Now energy = 22 - 2 = 20.\n    - 3rd task. Now energy = 20 - 3 = 17.\n    - 1st task. Now energy = 17 - 1 = 16.\n    - 4th task. Now energy = 16 - 4 = 12.\n    - 6th task. Now energy = 12 - 6 = 6.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= tasks.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= actual​i <= minimumi <= 104`",
