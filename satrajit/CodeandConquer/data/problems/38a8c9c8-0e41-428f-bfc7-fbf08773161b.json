  "description": "You are given two positive integers `n` and `target`.\n\nAn integer is considered **beautiful** if the sum of its digits is less than or equal to `target`.\n\nReturn the _minimum **non-negative** integer_ `x` _such that_ `n + x` _is beautiful_. The input will be generated such that it is always possible to make `n` beautiful.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 16, target = 6\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** Initially n is 16 and its digit sum is 1 + 6 = 7. After adding 4, n becomes 20 and digit sum becomes 2 + 0 = 2. It can be shown that we can not make n beautiful with adding non-negative integer less than 4.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 467, target = 6\n**Output:** 33\n**Explanation:** Initially n is 467 and its digit sum is 4 + 6 + 7 = 17. After adding 33, n becomes 500 and digit sum becomes 5 + 0 + 0 = 5. It can be shown that we can not make n beautiful with adding non-negative integer less than 33.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** n = 1, target = 1\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** Initially n is 1 and its digit sum is 1, which is already smaller than or equal to target.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= n <= 1012`\n*   `1 <= target <= 150`\n*   The input will be generated such that it is always possible to make `n` beautiful.",
