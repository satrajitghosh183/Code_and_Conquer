  "title": "Maximal Network Rank",
  "slug": "maximal-network-rank",
  "description": "There is an infrastructure of `n` cities with some number of `roads` connecting these cities. Each `roads[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities `ai` and `bi`.\n\nThe **network rank** of **two different cities** is defined as the total number of **directly** connected roads to **either** city. If a road is directly connected to both cities, it is only counted **once**.\n\nThe **maximal network rank** of the infrastructure is the **maximum network rank** of all pairs of different cities.\n\nGiven the integer `n` and the array `roads`, return _the **maximal network rank** of the entire infrastructure_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** n = 4, roads = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[0,3\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[1,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** The network rank of cities 0 and 1 is 4 as there are 4 roads that are connected to either 0 or 1. The road between 0 and 1 is only counted once.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** n = 5, roads = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[0,3\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[1,3\\],\\[2,3\\],\\[2,4\\]\\]\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** There are 5 roads that are connected to cities 1 or 2.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** n = 8, roads = \\[\\[0,1\\],\\[1,2\\],\\[2,3\\],\\[2,4\\],\\[5,6\\],\\[5,7\\]\\]\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** The network rank of 2 and 5 is 5. Notice that all the cities do not have to be connected.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= n <= 100`\n*   `0 <= roads.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`\n*   `roads[i].length == 2`\n*   `0 <= ai, bi <= n-1`\n*   `ai != bi`\n*   Each pair of cities has **at most one** road connecting them.",
