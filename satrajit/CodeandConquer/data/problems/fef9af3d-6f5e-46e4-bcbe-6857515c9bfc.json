  "description": "You are given two integers `m` and `n` that represent the height and width of a rectangular piece of wood. You are also given a 2D integer array `prices`, where `prices[i] = [hi, wi, pricei]` indicates you can sell a rectangular piece of wood of height `hi` and width `wi` for `pricei` dollars.\n\nTo cut a piece of wood, you must make a vertical or horizontal cut across the **entire** height or width of the piece to split it into two smaller pieces. After cutting a piece of wood into some number of smaller pieces, you can sell pieces according to `prices`. You may sell multiple pieces of the same shape, and you do not have to sell all the shapes. The grain of the wood makes a difference, so you **cannot** rotate a piece to swap its height and width.\n\nReturn _the **maximum** money you can earn after cutting an_ `m x n` _piece of wood_.\n\nNote that you can cut the piece of wood as many times as you want.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** m = 3, n = 5, prices = \\[\\[1,4,2\\],\\[2,2,7\\],\\[2,1,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** 19\n**Explanation:** The diagram above shows a possible scenario. It consists of:\n- 2 pieces of wood shaped 2 x 2, selling for a price of 2 \\* 7 = 14.\n- 1 piece of wood shaped 2 x 1, selling for a price of 1 \\* 3 = 3.\n- 1 piece of wood shaped 1 x 4, selling for a price of 1 \\* 2 = 2.\nThis obtains a total of 14 + 3 + 2 = 19 money earned.\nIt can be shown that 19 is the maximum amount of money that can be earned.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** m = 4, n = 6, prices = \\[\\[3,2,10\\],\\[1,4,2\\],\\[4,1,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** 32\n**Explanation:** The diagram above shows a possible scenario. It consists of:\n- 3 pieces of wood shaped 3 x 2, selling for a price of 3 \\* 10 = 30.\n- 1 piece of wood shaped 1 x 4, selling for a price of 1 \\* 2 = 2.\nThis obtains a total of 30 + 2 = 32 money earned.\nIt can be shown that 32 is the maximum amount of money that can be earned.\nNotice that we cannot rotate the 1 x 4 piece of wood to obtain a 4 x 1 piece of wood.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`\n*   `1 <= prices.length <= 2 * 104`\n*   `prices[i].length == 3`\n*   `1 <= hi <= m`\n*   `1 <= wi <= n`\n*   `1 <= pricei <= 106`\n*   All the shapes of wood `(hi, wi)` are pairwise **distinct**.",
