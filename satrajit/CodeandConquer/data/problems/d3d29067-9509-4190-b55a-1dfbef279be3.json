  "description": "You are given an integer `total` indicating the amount of money you have. You are also given two integers `cost1` and `cost2` indicating the price of a pen and pencil respectively. You can spend **part or all** of your money to buy multiple quantities (or none) of each kind of writing utensil.\n\nReturn _the **number of distinct ways** you can buy some number of pens and pencils._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** total = 20, cost1 = 10, cost2 = 5\n**Output:** 9\n**Explanation:** The price of a pen is 10 and the price of a pencil is 5.\n- If you buy 0 pens, you can buy 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 pencils.\n- If you buy 1 pen, you can buy 0, 1, or 2 pencils.\n- If you buy 2 pens, you cannot buy any pencils.\nThe total number of ways to buy pens and pencils is 5 + 3 + 1 = 9.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** total = 5, cost1 = 10, cost2 = 10\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** The price of both pens and pencils are 10, which cost more than total, so you cannot buy any writing utensils. Therefore, there is only 1 way: buy 0 pens and 0 pencils.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= total, cost1, cost2 <= 106`",
