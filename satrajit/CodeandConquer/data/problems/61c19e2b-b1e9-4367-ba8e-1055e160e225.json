  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** positive integer array `nums` and a positive integer `k`.\n\nA pair of numbers `(num1, num2)` is called **excellent** if the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n*   **Both** the numbers `num1` and `num2` exist in the array `nums`.\n*   The sum of the number of set bits in `num1 OR num2` and `num1 AND num2` is greater than or equal to `k`, where `OR` is the bitwise **OR** operation and `AND` is the bitwise **AND** operation.\n\nReturn _the number of **distinct** excellent pairs_.\n\nTwo pairs `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` are considered distinct if either `a != c` or `b != d`. For example, `(1, 2)` and `(2, 1)` are distinct.\n\n**Note** that a pair `(num1, num2)` such that `num1 == num2` can also be excellent if you have at least **one** occurrence of `num1` in the array.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[1,2,3,1\\], k = 3\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** The excellent pairs are the following:\n- (3, 3). (3 AND 3) and (3 OR 3) are both equal to (11) in binary. The total number of set bits is 2 + 2 = 4, which is greater than or equal to k = 3.\n- (2, 3) and (3, 2). (2 AND 3) is equal to (10) in binary, and (2 OR 3) is equal to (11) in binary. The total number of set bits is 1 + 2 = 3.\n- (1, 3) and (3, 1). (1 AND 3) is equal to (01) in binary, and (1 OR 3) is equal to (11) in binary. The total number of set bits is 1 + 2 = 3.\nSo the number of excellent pairs is 5.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[5,1,1\\], k = 10\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** There are no excellent pairs for this array.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`\n*   `1 <= k <= 60`",
