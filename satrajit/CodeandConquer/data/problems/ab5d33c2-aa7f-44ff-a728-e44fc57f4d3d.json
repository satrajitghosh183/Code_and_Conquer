  "slug": "maximum-trailing-zeros-in-a-cornered-path",
  "description": "You are given a 2D integer array `grid` of size `m x n`, where each cell contains a positive integer.\n\nA **cornered path** is defined as a set of adjacent cells with **at most** one turn. More specifically, the path should exclusively move either **horizontally** or **vertically** up to the turn (if there is one), without returning to a previously visited cell. After the turn, the path will then move exclusively in the **alternate** direction: move vertically if it moved horizontally, and vice versa, also without returning to a previously visited cell.\n\nThe **product** of a path is defined as the product of all the values in the path.\n\nReturn _the **maximum** number of **trailing zeros** in the product of a cornered path found in_ `grid`.\n\nNote:\n\n*   **Horizontal** movement means moving in either the left or right direction.\n*   **Vertical** movement means moving in either the up or down direction.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[23,17,15,3,20\\],\\[8,1,20,27,11\\],\\[9,4,6,2,21\\],\\[40,9,1,10,6\\],\\[22,7,4,5,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** The grid on the left shows a valid cornered path.\nIt has a product of 15 \\* 20 \\* 6 \\* 1 \\* 10 = 18000 which has 3 trailing zeros.\nIt can be shown that this is the maximum trailing zeros in the product of a cornered path.\n\nThe grid in the middle is not a cornered path as it has more than one turn.\nThe grid on the right is not a cornered path as it requires a return to a previously visited cell.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[\\[4,3,2\\],\\[7,6,1\\],\\[8,8,8\\]\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** The grid is shown in the figure above.\nThere are no cornered paths in the grid that result in a product with a trailing zero.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `m == grid.length`\n*   `n == grid[i].length`\n*   `1 <= m, n <= 105`\n*   `1 <= m * n <= 105`\n*   `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 1000`",
