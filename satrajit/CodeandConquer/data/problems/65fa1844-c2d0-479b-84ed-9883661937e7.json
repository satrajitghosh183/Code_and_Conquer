  "description": "There are some robots and factories on the X-axis. You are given an integer array `robot` where `robot[i]` is the position of the `ith` robot. You are also given a 2D integer array `factory` where `factory[j] = [positionj, limitj]` indicates that `positionj` is the position of the `jth` factory and that the `jth` factory can repair at most `limitj` robots.\n\nThe positions of each robot are **unique**. The positions of each factory are also **unique**. Note that a robot can be **in the same position** as a factory initially.\n\nAll the robots are initially broken; they keep moving in one direction. The direction could be the negative or the positive direction of the X-axis. When a robot reaches a factory that did not reach its limit, the factory repairs the robot, and it stops moving.\n\n**At any moment**, you can set the initial direction of moving for **some** robot. Your target is to minimize the total distance traveled by all the robots.\n\nReturn _the minimum total distance traveled by all the robots_. The test cases are generated such that all the robots can be repaired.\n\n**Note that**\n\n*   All robots move at the same speed.\n*   If two robots move in the same direction, they will never collide.\n*   If two robots move in opposite directions and they meet at some point, they do not collide. They cross each other.\n*   If a robot passes by a factory that reached its limits, it crosses it as if it does not exist.\n*   If the robot moved from a position `x` to a position `y`, the distance it moved is `|y - x|`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** robot = \\[0,4,6\\], factory = \\[\\[2,2\\],\\[6,2\\]\\]\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** As shown in the figure:\n- The first robot at position 0 moves in the positive direction. It will be repaired at the first factory.\n- The second robot at position 4 moves in the negative direction. It will be repaired at the first factory.\n- The third robot at position 6 will be repaired at the second factory. It does not need to move.\nThe limit of the first factory is 2, and it fixed 2 robots.\nThe limit of the second factory is 2, and it fixed 1 robot.\nThe total distance is |2 - 0| + |2 - 4| + |6 - 6| = 4. It can be shown that we cannot achieve a better total distance than 4.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** robot = \\[1,-1\\], factory = \\[\\[-2,1\\],\\[2,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** As shown in the figure:\n- The first robot at position 1 moves in the positive direction. It will be repaired at the second factory.\n- The second robot at position -1 moves in the negative direction. It will be repaired at the first factory.\nThe limit of the first factory is 1, and it fixed 1 robot.\nThe limit of the second factory is 1, and it fixed 1 robot.\nThe total distance is |2 - 1| + |(-2) - (-1)| = 2. It can be shown that we cannot achieve a better total distance than 2.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= robot.length, factory.length <= 100`\n*   `factory[j].length == 2`\n*   `-109 <= robot[i], positionj <= 109`\n*   `0 <= limitj <= robot.length`\n*   The input will be generated such that it is always possible to repair every robot.",
