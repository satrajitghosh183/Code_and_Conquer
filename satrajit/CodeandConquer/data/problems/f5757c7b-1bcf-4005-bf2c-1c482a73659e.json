  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `stations` of length `n`, where `stations[i]` represents the number of power stations in the `ith` city.\n\nEach power station can provide power to every city in a fixed **range**. In other words, if the range is denoted by `r`, then a power station at city `i` can provide power to all cities `j` such that `|i - j| <= r` and `0 <= i, j <= n - 1`.\n\n*   Note that `|x|` denotes **absolute** value. For example, `|7 - 5| = 2` and `|3 - 10| = 7`.\n\nThe **power** of a city is the total number of power stations it is being provided power from.\n\nThe government has sanctioned building `k` more power stations, each of which can be built in any city, and have the same range as the pre-existing ones.\n\nGiven the two integers `r` and `k`, return _the **maximum possible minimum power** of a city, if the additional power stations are built optimally._\n\n**Note** that you can build the `k` power stations in multiple cities.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** stations = \\[1,2,4,5,0\\], r = 1, k = 2\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** \nOne of the optimal ways is to install both the power stations at city 1. \nSo stations will become \\[1,4,4,5,0\\].\n- City 0 is provided by 1 + 4 = 5 power stations.\n- City 1 is provided by 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 power stations.\n- City 2 is provided by 4 + 4 + 5 = 13 power stations.\n- City 3 is provided by 5 + 4 = 9 power stations.\n- City 4 is provided by 5 + 0 = 5 power stations.\nSo the minimum power of a city is 5.\nSince it is not possible to obtain a larger power, we return 5.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** stations = \\[4,4,4,4\\], r = 0, k = 3\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** \nIt can be proved that we cannot make the minimum power of a city greater than 4.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == stations.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 105`\n*   `0 <= stations[i] <= 105`\n*   `0 <= r <= n - 1`\n*   `0 <= k <= 109`",
