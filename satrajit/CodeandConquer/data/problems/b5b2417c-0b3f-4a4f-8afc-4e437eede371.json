  "slug": "height-of-binary-tree-after-subtree-removal-queries",
  "description": "You are given the `root` of a **binary tree** with `n` nodes. Each node is assigned a unique value from `1` to `n`. You are also given an array `queries` of size `m`.\n\nYou have to perform `m` **independent** queries on the tree where in the `ith` query you do the following:\n\n*   **Remove** the subtree rooted at the node with the value `queries[i]` from the tree. It is **guaranteed** that `queries[i]` will **not** be equal to the value of the root.\n\nReturn _an array_ `answer` _of size_ `m` _where_ `answer[i]` _is the height of the tree after performing the_ `ith` _query_.\n\n**Note**:\n\n*   The queries are independent, so the tree returns to its **initial** state after each query.\n*   The height of a tree is the **number of edges in the longest simple path** from the root to some node in the tree.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** root = \\[1,3,4,2,null,6,5,null,null,null,null,null,7\\], queries = \\[4\\]\n**Output:** \\[2\\]\n**Explanation:** The diagram above shows the tree after removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4.\nThe height of the tree is 2 (The path 1 -> 3 -> 2).\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** root = \\[5,8,9,2,1,3,7,4,6\\], queries = \\[3,2,4,8\\]\n**Output:** \\[3,2,3,2\\]\n**Explanation:** We have the following queries:\n- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 3. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 4).\n- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 2. The height of the tree becomes 2 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 1).\n- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 6).\n- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 8. The height of the tree becomes 2 (The path 5 -> 9 -> 3).\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.\n*   `2 <= n <= 105`\n*   `1 <= Node.val <= n`\n*   All the values in the tree are **unique**.\n*   `m == queries.length`\n*   `1 <= m <= min(n, 104)`\n*   `1 <= queries[i] <= n`\n*   `queries[i] != root.val`",
