  "slug": "find-score-of-an-array-after-marking-all-elements",
  "description": "You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers.\n\nStarting with `score = 0`, apply the following algorithm:\n\n*   Choose the smallest integer of the array that is not marked. If there is a tie, choose the one with the smallest index.\n*   Add the value of the chosen integer to `score`.\n*   Mark **the chosen element and its two adjacent elements if they exist**.\n*   Repeat until all the array elements are marked.\n\nReturn _the score you get after applying the above algorithm_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[2,1,3,4,5,2\\]\n**Output:** 7\n**Explanation:** We mark the elements as follows:\n- 1 is the smallest unmarked element, so we mark it and its two adjacent elements: \\[2,1,3,4,5,2\\].\n- 2 is the smallest unmarked element, so we mark it and its left adjacent element: \\[2,1,3,4,5,2\\].\n- 4 is the only remaining unmarked element, so we mark it: \\[2,1,3,4,5,2\\].\nOur score is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[2,3,5,1,3,2\\]\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** We mark the elements as follows:\n- 1 is the smallest unmarked element, so we mark it and its two adjacent elements: \\[2,3,5,1,3,2\\].\n- 2 is the smallest unmarked element, since there are two of them, we choose the left-most one, so we mark the one at index 0 and its right adjacent element: \\[2,3,5,1,3,2\\].\n- 2 is the only remaining unmarked element, so we mark it: \\[2,3,5,1,3,2\\].\nOur score is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 106`",
