  "description": "There is a country of `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1` where **all the cities are connected** by bi-directional roads. The roads are represented as a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [xi, yi, timei]` denotes a road between cities `xi` and `yi` that takes `timei` minutes to travel. There may be multiple roads of differing travel times connecting the same two cities, but no road connects a city to itself.\n\nEach time you pass through a city, you must pay a passing fee. This is represented as a **0-indexed** integer array `passingFees` of length `n` where `passingFees[j]` is the amount of dollars you must pay when you pass through city `j`.\n\nIn the beginning, you are at city `0` and want to reach city `n - 1` in `maxTime` **minutes or less**. The **cost** of your journey is the **summation of passing fees** for each city that you passed through at some moment of your journey (**including** the source and destination cities).\n\nGiven `maxTime`, `edges`, and `passingFees`, return _the **minimum cost** to complete your journey, or_ `-1` _if you cannot complete it within_ `maxTime` _minutes_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** maxTime = 30, edges = \\[\\[0,1,10\\],\\[1,2,10\\],\\[2,5,10\\],\\[0,3,1\\],\\[3,4,10\\],\\[4,5,15\\]\\], passingFees = \\[5,1,2,20,20,3\\]\n**Output:** 11\n**Explanation:** The path to take is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5, which takes 30 minutes and has $11 worth of passing fees.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** maxTime = 29, edges = \\[\\[0,1,10\\],\\[1,2,10\\],\\[2,5,10\\],\\[0,3,1\\],\\[3,4,10\\],\\[4,5,15\\]\\], passingFees = \\[5,1,2,20,20,3\\]\n**Output:** 48\n**Explanation:** The path to take is 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, which takes 26 minutes and has $48 worth of passing fees.\nYou cannot take path 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5 since it would take too long.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** maxTime = 25, edges = \\[\\[0,1,10\\],\\[1,2,10\\],\\[2,5,10\\],\\[0,3,1\\],\\[3,4,10\\],\\[4,5,15\\]\\], passingFees = \\[5,1,2,20,20,3\\]\n**Output:** -1\n**Explanation:** There is no way to reach city 5 from city 0 within 25 minutes.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= maxTime <= 1000`\n*   `n == passingFees.length`\n*   `2 <= n <= 1000`\n*   `n - 1 <= edges.length <= 1000`\n*   `0 <= xi, yi <= n - 1`\n*   `1 <= timei <= 1000`\n*   `1 <= passingFees[j] <= 1000`\n*   The graph may contain multiple edges between two nodes.\n*   The graph does not contain self loops.",
