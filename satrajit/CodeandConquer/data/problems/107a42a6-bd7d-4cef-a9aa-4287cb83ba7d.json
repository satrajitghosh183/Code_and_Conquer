  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. An index `i` is part of a **hill** in `nums` if the closest non-equal neighbors of `i` are smaller than `nums[i]`. Similarly, an index `i` is part of a **valley** in `nums` if the closest non-equal neighbors of `i` are larger than `nums[i]`. Adjacent indices `i` and `j` are part of the **same** hill or valley if `nums[i] == nums[j]`.\n\nNote that for an index to be part of a hill or valley, it must have a non-equal neighbor on **both** the left and right of the index.\n\nReturn _the number of hills and valleys in_ `nums`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[2,4,1,1,6,5\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:**\nAt index 0: There is no non-equal neighbor of 2 on the left, so index 0 is neither a hill nor a valley.\nAt index 1: The closest non-equal neighbors of 4 are 2 and 1. Since 4 > 2 and 4 > 1, index 1 is a hill. \nAt index 2: The closest non-equal neighbors of 1 are 4 and 6. Since 1 < 4 and 1 < 6, index 2 is a valley.\nAt index 3: The closest non-equal neighbors of 1 are 4 and 6. Since 1 < 4 and 1 < 6, index 3 is a valley, but note that it is part of the same valley as index 2.\nAt index 4: The closest non-equal neighbors of 6 are 1 and 5. Since 6 > 1 and 6 > 5, index 4 is a hill.\nAt index 5: There is no non-equal neighbor of 5 on the right, so index 5 is neither a hill nor a valley. \nThere are 3 hills and valleys so we return 3.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[6,6,5,5,4,1\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:**\nAt index 0: There is no non-equal neighbor of 6 on the left, so index 0 is neither a hill nor a valley.\nAt index 1: There is no non-equal neighbor of 6 on the left, so index 1 is neither a hill nor a valley.\nAt index 2: The closest non-equal neighbors of 5 are 6 and 4. Since 5 < 6 and 5 > 4, index 2 is neither a hill nor a valley.\nAt index 3: The closest non-equal neighbors of 5 are 6 and 4. Since 5 < 6 and 5 > 4, index 3 is neither a hill nor a valley.\nAt index 4: The closest non-equal neighbors of 4 are 5 and 1. Since 4 < 5 and 4 > 1, index 4 is neither a hill nor a valley.\nAt index 5: There is no non-equal neighbor of 1 on the right, so index 5 is neither a hill nor a valley.\nThere are 0 hills and valleys so we return 0.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `3 <= nums.length <= 100`\n*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`",
