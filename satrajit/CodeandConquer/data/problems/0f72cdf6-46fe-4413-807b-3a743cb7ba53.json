  "description": "Given the `postfix` tokens of an arithmetic expression, build and return _the binary expression tree that represents this expression._\n\n**Postfix** notation is a notation for writing arithmetic expressions in which the operands (numbers) appear before their operators. For example, the postfix tokens of the expression `4*(5-(7+2))` are represented in the array `postfix = [ \"4 \", \"5 \", \"7 \", \"2 \", \"+ \", \"- \", \"* \"]`.\n\nThe class `Node` is an interface you should use to implement the binary expression tree. The returned tree will be tested using the `evaluate` function, which is supposed to evaluate the tree's value. You should not remove the `Node` class; however, you can modify it as you wish, and you can define other classes to implement it if needed.\n\nA **[binary expression tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree)** is a kind of binary tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands (numbers), and internal nodes (nodes with two children) correspond to the operators `'+'` (addition), `'-'` (subtraction), `'*'` (multiplication), and `'/'` (division).\n\nIt's guaranteed that no subtree will yield a value that exceeds `109` in absolute value, and all the operations are valid (i.e., no division by zero).\n\n**Follow up:** Could you design the expression tree such that it is more modular? For example, is your design able to support additional operators without making changes to your existing `evaluate` implementation?\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s = \\[ \"3 \", \"4 \", \"+ \", \"2 \", \"\\* \", \"7 \", \"/ \"\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** this expression evaluates to the above binary tree with expression (`(3+4)*2)/7) = 14/7 = 2.`\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s = \\[ \"4 \", \"5 \", \"2 \", \"7 \", \"+ \", \"- \", \"\\* \"\\]\n**Output:** -16\n**Explanation:** this expression evaluates to the above binary tree with expression 4\\*(5-`(2+7)) = 4*(-4) = -16.`\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= s.length < 100`\n*   `s.length` is odd.\n*   `s` consists of numbers and the characters `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, and `'/'`.\n*   If `s[i]` is a number, its integer representation is no more than `105`.\n*   It is guaranteed that `s` is a valid expression.\n*   The absolute value of the result and intermediate values will not exceed `109`.\n*   It is guaranteed that no expression will include division by zero.",
