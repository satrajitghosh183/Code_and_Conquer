  "description": "You are given a string `title` consisting of one or more words separated by a single space, where each word consists of English letters. **Capitalize** the string by changing the capitalization of each word such that:\n\n*   If the length of the word is `1` or `2` letters, change all letters to lowercase.\n*   Otherwise, change the first letter to uppercase and the remaining letters to lowercase.\n\nReturn _the **capitalized**_ `title`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** title =  \"capiTalIze tHe titLe \"\n**Output:**  \"Capitalize The Title \"\n**Explanation:**\nSince all the words have a length of at least 3, the first letter of each word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** title =  \"First leTTeR of EACH Word \"\n**Output:**  \"First Letter of Each Word \"\n**Explanation:**\nThe word  \"of \" has length 2, so it is all lowercase.\nThe remaining words have a length of at least 3, so the first letter of each remaining word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** title =  \"i lOve leetcode \"\n**Output:**  \"i Love Leetcode \"\n**Explanation:**\nThe word  \"i \" has length 1, so it is lowercase.\nThe remaining words have a length of at least 3, so the first letter of each remaining word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= title.length <= 100`\n*   `title` consists of words separated by a single space without any leading or trailing spaces.\n*   Each word consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and is **non-empty**.",
