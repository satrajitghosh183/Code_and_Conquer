  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `peaks` where `peaks[i] = [xi, yi]` states that mountain `i` has a peak at coordinates `(xi, yi)`. A mountain can be described as a right-angled isosceles triangle, with its base along the `x`\\-axis and a right angle at its peak. More formally, the **gradients** of ascending and descending the mountain are `1` and `-1` respectively.\n\nA mountain is considered **visible** if its peak does not lie within another mountain (including the border of other mountains).\n\nReturn _the number of visible mountains_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** peaks = \\[\\[2,2\\],\\[6,3\\],\\[5,4\\]\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** The diagram above shows the mountains.\n- Mountain 0 is visible since its peak does not lie within another mountain or its sides.\n- Mountain 1 is not visible since its peak lies within the side of mountain 2.\n- Mountain 2 is visible since its peak does not lie within another mountain or its sides.\nThere are 2 mountains that are visible.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** peaks = \\[\\[1,3\\],\\[1,3\\]\\]\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** The diagram above shows the mountains (they completely overlap).\nBoth mountains are not visible since their peaks lie within each other.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= peaks.length <= 105`\n*   `peaks[i].length == 2`\n*   `1 <= xi, yi <= 105`",
