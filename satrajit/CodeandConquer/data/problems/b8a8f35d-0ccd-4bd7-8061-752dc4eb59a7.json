  "description": "A game is played by a cat and a mouse named Cat and Mouse.\n\nThe environment is represented by a `grid` of size `rows x cols`, where each element is a wall, floor, player (Cat, Mouse), or food.\n\n*   Players are represented by the characters `'C'`(Cat)`,'M'`(Mouse).\n*   Floors are represented by the character `'.'` and can be walked on.\n*   Walls are represented by the character `'#'` and cannot be walked on.\n*   Food is represented by the character `'F'` and can be walked on.\n*   There is only one of each character `'C'`, `'M'`, and `'F'` in `grid`.\n\nMouse and Cat play according to the following rules:\n\n*   Mouse **moves first**, then they take turns to move.\n*   During each turn, Cat and Mouse can jump in one of the four directions (left, right, up, down). They cannot jump over the wall nor outside of the `grid`.\n*   `catJump, mouseJump` are the maximum lengths Cat and Mouse can jump at a time, respectively. Cat and Mouse can jump less than the maximum length.\n*   Staying in the same position is allowed.\n*   Mouse can jump over Cat.\n\nThe game can end in 4 ways:\n\n*   If Cat occupies the same position as Mouse, Cat wins.\n*   If Cat reaches the food first, Cat wins.\n*   If Mouse reaches the food first, Mouse wins.\n*   If Mouse cannot get to the food within 1000 turns, Cat wins.\n\nGiven a `rows x cols` matrix `grid` and two integers `catJump` and `mouseJump`, return `true` _if Mouse can win the game if both Cat and Mouse play optimally, otherwise return_ `false`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[ \"####F \", \"#C... \", \"M.... \"\\], catJump = 1, mouseJump = 2\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:** Cat cannot catch Mouse on its turn nor can it get the food before Mouse.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[ \"M.C...F \"\\], catJump = 1, mouseJump = 4\n**Output:** true\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** grid = \\[ \"M.C...F \"\\], catJump = 1, mouseJump = 3\n**Output:** false\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `rows == grid.length`\n*   `cols = grid[i].length`\n*   `1 <= rows, cols <= 8`\n*   `grid[i][j]` consist only of characters `'C'`, `'M'`, `'F'`, `'.'`, and `'#'`.\n*   There is only one of each character `'C'`, `'M'`, and `'F'` in `grid`.\n*   `1 <= catJump, mouseJump <= 8`",
