  "description": "There are two types of persons:\n\n*   The **good person**: The person who always tells the truth.\n*   The **bad person**: The person who might tell the truth and might lie.\n\nYou are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `statements` of size `n x n` that represents the statements made by `n` people about each other. More specifically, `statements[i][j]` could be one of the following:\n\n*   `0` which represents a statement made by person `i` that person `j` is a **bad** person.\n*   `1` which represents a statement made by person `i` that person `j` is a **good** person.\n*   `2` represents that **no statement** is made by person `i` about person `j`.\n\nAdditionally, no person ever makes a statement about themselves. Formally, we have that `statements[i][i] = 2` for all `0 <= i < n`.\n\nReturn _the **maximum** number of people who can be **good** based on the statements made by the_ `n` _people_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** statements = \\[\\[2,1,2\\],\\[1,2,2\\],\\[2,0,2\\]\\]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** Each person makes a single statement.\n- Person 0 states that person 1 is good.\n- Person 1 states that person 0 is good.\n- Person 2 states that person 1 is bad.\nLet's take person 2 as the key.\n- Assuming that person 2 is a good person:\n    - Based on the statement made by person 2, person 1 is a bad person.\n    - Now we know for sure that person 1 is bad and person 2 is good.\n    - Based on the statement made by person 1, and since person 1 is bad, they could be:\n        - telling the truth. There will be a contradiction in this case and this assumption is invalid.\n        - lying. In this case, person 0 is also a bad person and lied in their statement.\n    - **Following that person 2 is a good person, there will be only one good person in the group**.\n- Assuming that person 2 is a bad person:\n    - Based on the statement made by person 2, and since person 2 is bad, they could be:\n        - telling the truth. Following this scenario, person 0 and 1 are both bad as explained before.\n            - **Following that person 2 is bad but told the truth, there will be no good persons in the group**.\n        - lying. In this case person 1 is a good person.\n            - Since person 1 is a good person, person 0 is also a good person.\n            - **Following that person 2 is bad and lied, there will be two good persons in the group**.\nWe can see that at most 2 persons are good in the best case, so we return 2.\nNote that there is more than one way to arrive at this conclusion.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** statements = \\[\\[2,0\\],\\[0,2\\]\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** Each person makes a single statement.\n- Person 0 states that person 1 is bad.\n- Person 1 states that person 0 is bad.\nLet's take person 0 as the key.\n- Assuming that person 0 is a good person:\n    - Based on the statement made by person 0, person 1 is a bad person and was lying.\n    - **Following that person 0 is a good person, there will be only one good person in the group**.\n- Assuming that person 0 is a bad person:\n    - Based on the statement made by person 0, and since person 0 is bad, they could be:\n        - telling the truth. Following this scenario, person 0 and 1 are both bad.\n            - **Following that person 0 is bad but told the truth, there will be no good persons in the group**.\n        - lying. In this case person 1 is a good person.\n            - **Following that person 0 is bad and lied, there will be only one good person in the group**.\nWe can see that at most, one person is good in the best case, so we return 1.\nNote that there is more than one way to arrive at this conclusion.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == statements.length == statements[i].length`\n*   `2 <= n <= 15`\n*   `statements[i][j]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.\n*   `statements[i][i] == 2`",
