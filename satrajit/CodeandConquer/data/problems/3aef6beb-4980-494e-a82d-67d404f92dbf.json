  "description": "You are given the `root` of a **binary tree** that consists of exactly `3` nodes: the root, its left child, and its right child.\n\nReturn `true` _if the value of the root is equal to the **sum** of the values of its two children, or_ `false` _otherwise_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** root = \\[10,4,6\\]\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:** The values of the root, its left child, and its right child are 10, 4, and 6, respectively.\n10 is equal to 4 + 6, so we return true.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** root = \\[5,3,1\\]\n**Output:** false\n**Explanation:** The values of the root, its left child, and its right child are 5, 3, and 1, respectively.\n5 is not equal to 3 + 1, so we return false.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   The tree consists only of the root, its left child, and its right child.\n*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`",
