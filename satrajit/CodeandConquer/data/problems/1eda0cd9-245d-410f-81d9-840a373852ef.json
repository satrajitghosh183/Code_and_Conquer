  "description": "You have two fruit baskets containing `n` fruits each. You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `basket1` and `basket2` representing the cost of fruit in each basket. You want to make both baskets **equal**. To do so, you can use the following operation as many times as you want:\n\n*   Chose two indices `i` and `j`, and swap the `ith` fruit of `basket1` with the `jth` fruit of `basket2`.\n*   The cost of the swap is `min(basket1[i],basket2[j])`.\n\nTwo baskets are considered equal if sorting them according to the fruit cost makes them exactly the same baskets.\n\nReturn _the minimum cost to make both the baskets equal or_ `-1` _if impossible._\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** basket1 = \\[4,2,2,2\\], basket2 = \\[1,4,1,2\\]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** Swap index 1 of basket1 with index 0 of basket2, which has cost 1. Now basket1 = \\[4,1,2,2\\] and basket2 = \\[2,4,1,2\\]. Rearranging both the arrays makes them equal.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** basket1 = \\[2,3,4,1\\], basket2 = \\[3,2,5,1\\]\n**Output:** -1\n**Explanation:** It can be shown that it is impossible to make both the baskets equal.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `basket1.length == bakste2.length`\n*   `1 <= basket1.length <= 105`\n*   `1 <= basket1[i],basket2[i] <= 109`",
