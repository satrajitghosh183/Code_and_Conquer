  "description": "You are given a **0-indexed** string `word`, consisting of lowercase English letters. You need to select **one** index and **remove** the letter at that index from `word` so that the **frequency** of every letter present in `word` is equal.\n\nReturn `true` _if it is possible to remove one letter so that the frequency of all letters in_ `word` _are equal, and_ `false` _otherwise_.\n\n**Note:**\n\n*   The **frequency** of a letter `x` is the number of times it occurs in the string.\n*   You **must** remove exactly one letter and cannot chose to do nothing.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** word =  \"abcc \"\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:** Select index 3 and delete it: word becomes  \"abc \" and each character has a frequency of 1.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** word =  \"aazz \"\n**Output:** false\n**Explanation:** We must delete a character, so either the frequency of  \"a \" is 1 and the frequency of  \"z \" is 2, or vice versa. It is impossible to make all present letters have equal frequency.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `2 <= word.length <= 100`\n*   `word` consists of lowercase English letters only.",
