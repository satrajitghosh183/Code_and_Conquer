  "slug": "count-sub-islands",
  "description": "You are given two `m x n` binary matrices `grid1` and `grid2` containing only `0`'s (representing water) and `1`'s (representing land). An **island** is a group of `1`'s connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical). Any cells outside of the grid are considered water cells.\n\nAn island in `grid2` is considered a **sub-island** if there is an island in `grid1` that contains **all** the cells that make up **this** island in `grid2`.\n\nReturn the _**number** of islands in_ `grid2` _that are considered **sub-islands**_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** grid1 = \\[\\[1,1,1,0,0\\],\\[0,1,1,1,1\\],\\[0,0,0,0,0\\],\\[1,0,0,0,0\\],\\[1,1,0,1,1\\]\\], grid2 = \\[\\[1,1,1,0,0\\],\\[0,0,1,1,1\\],\\[0,1,0,0,0\\],\\[1,0,1,1,0\\],\\[0,1,0,1,0\\]\\]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** In the picture above, the grid on the left is grid1 and the grid on the right is grid2.\nThe 1s colored red in grid2 are those considered to be part of a sub-island. There are three sub-islands.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** grid1 = \\[\\[1,0,1,0,1\\],\\[1,1,1,1,1\\],\\[0,0,0,0,0\\],\\[1,1,1,1,1\\],\\[1,0,1,0,1\\]\\], grid2 = \\[\\[0,0,0,0,0\\],\\[1,1,1,1,1\\],\\[0,1,0,1,0\\],\\[0,1,0,1,0\\],\\[1,0,0,0,1\\]\\]\n**Output:** 2 \n**Explanation:** In the picture above, the grid on the left is grid1 and the grid on the right is grid2.\nThe 1s colored red in grid2 are those considered to be part of a sub-island. There are two sub-islands.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `m == grid1.length == grid2.length`\n*   `n == grid1[i].length == grid2[i].length`\n*   `1 <= m, n <= 500`\n*   `grid1[i][j]` and `grid2[i][j]` are either `0` or `1`.",
